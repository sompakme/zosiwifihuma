Over the years, RiRi was linked to plenty of famous men and while she everyone knows the star dated Chris Brown, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake</a>, and Hassan Jameel, there are some other familiar faces RiRi was spotted with regularly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest Kardashian/Jenner Exes, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>This list is ranking the men that Rihanna has been linked to based on their wealth and without spoiling too much — let’s just say that the number one has an estimated net worth of $1.9 billion. However, RiRi — who is currently single — definitely doesn’t need a man to afford things as the singer has a net worth of $600 million!</p><h2 id=karim-benzema-net-worth-40-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Karim Benzema — Net Worth&nbsp;$40 Million</span></h2><p>Kicking the list off on spot number 10 of men <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a> has been linked to is French professional football player Karim Benzema who currently plays as a striker for the Spanish club Real Madrid.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, his net worth is currently estimated to be around $40 million and singer RiRi was linked to the athlete in June 2015, when the two were spotted hanging out together. A photo from one of their encounters during that summer can be seen above!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-brown-net-worth-50-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Chris Brown — Net Worth $50 Million</span></h2><p>Next on the list is one of Rihanna‘s most famous relationship — the one she had with fellow musician Chris Brown. The two stars dated from 2007 until 2013 and everyone surely remembers that their love story&nbsp;had a bad turn when things ended&nbsp;in assault in 2009.</p><p>However, even after that, the two were rumored to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still be&nbsp;a thing</a> and those rumors only cooled down in 2013. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Chris Brown is worth $50 million, making him the 9th richest man Rihanna has been linked to!</p><h2 id=travis-scott-net-worth-50-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Travis Scott — Net Worth $50 Million</span></h2><p>Number 8 on the list is a rapper Travis Scott who was linked to the Barbadian singer in 2015 and 2016. Above is a photo of Rihanna and Travis Scott attending a music event together, and it certainly seemed as if they enjoyed each other's company.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis Scott Secretly Dated Rihanna… This Is Why It Was Kept Quiet</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Currently, Travis Scott is estimated to have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of $50 million, and as his fans probably already know — Travis eventually moved on from RiRi and started dating reality television star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner</a>, whom he has a daughter with.</p><h2 id=colin-farrell-net-worth-80-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Colin Farrell — Net Worth $80 Million</span></h2><p>Another famous male celebrity who was linked to singer Rihanna is Hollywood star Colin Farrell. While, of course, neither of them has ever confirmed anything — back in 2011 it was rumored that the two are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more than just friends</a>.</p><p>At the time Rihanna was in an on-and-off-again relationship with Chris Brown and it certainly seemed as if she took full advantage of the "off" time with the famous Irish actor whose <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is estimated to be around $80 million!</p><h2 id=drake-net-worth-180-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Drake — Net Worth $180 Million</span></h2><p>One of Rihanna's longest and most speculated relationships is certainly the one with Canadian rapper Drake. The rumors of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two stars dating</a> first started in 2010, and frankly — they have never stopped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years the two musicians have collaborated on multiple songs which has certainly only fueled the rumors even more. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the Canadian star is currently worth around $180 million making him number 6 on the list of richest men RiRi has been linked to!</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake-net-worth-250-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Justin Timberlake — Net Worth $250 Million</span></h2><p>Opening up the top 5 richest men that Rihanna has been linked to is fellow pop star Justin Timberlake. As fans of either of the singers will already know — the two actually collaborated on the 2011 song "Rehab" which was released exactly around the time that it was rumored that the two are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">secretly dating</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Kanye West And Rihanna’s Relationship</a></span></p><p>Of course, both stars have denied it but in the world of the rich and famous, you never know.

As with most high-profile celebrities, both RiRi and Leo wouldn’t say much on their relationship but sometimes photos say a lot more than words.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Leonardo DiCaprio is currently worth an estimated $260 million but considering that he is one of the most successful actors of his generation — this number is bound to increase with time!</p><h2 id=lewis-hamilton-net-worth-285-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lewis Hamilton — Net Worth $285 Million</span></h2><p>Opening the top 3 richest men that singer Rihanna has been linked to is British racing driver Lewis Hamilton. Just like with Leonardo Dicaprio, Lewis was also linked to Rihanna back in 2015, and above is a photo of the two stars attending a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fun carnival in Barbados</a> together.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the British hunk currently has an estimated net worth of $285 million, making Lewis Hamilton the third richest man that RiRi had fun with!

Anyone who is familiar with Rihanna's career knows that JAY Z was actually the one who discovered the Barbadian and ever since then there have been rumors that JAY Z is more than friends with Rihanna.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Interesting Facts About Rihanna’s Longtime Friendship With Jay-Z</a></span></p><p>However, as fans of the rapper know, he has been with singer Beyoncé since the early 2000s and both Rihanna and JAY Z have always <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">denied</a> any of these rumors. Currently, the rapper's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> is estimated to be around $1 billion!</p><h2 id=hassan-jameel-net-worth-1-9-billion><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Hassan Jameel — Net Worth&nbsp;$1.9 Billion</span></h2><p>Number one on the list of the richest men that Rihanna was with is her most recent boyfriend Saudi Arabian businessman, Hassan Jameel. RiRi and Hassan started dating back in 2016 but unfortunately, the two decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">call it quits earlier this year</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Out of all of the men that the famous singer has been seen with, Hassan Jameel is by far the richest one with an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of around $1.9 billion.
