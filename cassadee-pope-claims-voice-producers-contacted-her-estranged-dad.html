They were like, ‘We found your father.’ And I was like, ‘I didn’t lose my father.’ I have his number.”</p><p>Pope claimed that <a href=#>producers approached her</a> with the idea to have an on-camera reunion with her dad — but she shut them down. “I genuinely felt like they saw me open up, they saw America react so strongly to me opening up about my story that they were like, ‘We know this will help her,’” she said. “They were, like, trying to help me do better in the competition, which I appreciated.”</p><p>Performing on TV was an “intense, overwhelming experience” overall, but Pope is still grateful for the bond she formed with Shelton, 47. She exclusively <a href=#>told Us Weekly in October 2021</a> that she and Shelton keep in touch “a little bit here and there.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He’s a busy guy,” she said. “But … you know, he’s been super supportive, he had me premiere my album [Stages] at an album release party a couple years ago at Ole Red downtown [in Nashville] and he let me use his venue for that. … I’m sure I’ll run into him at some point.”</p><p>Shelton was an original coach on the series, making his debut in 2011. While several artists have spun their red chairs around — from <a href=#><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a> — Shelton remained a <a href=#>constant presence</a> until season 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqaq6OWsaaxjKmmqZ1dmLmitcysZK%2BnmZiybrzRqJuum5WnwG6vzqermpukmrFutMSrZJ6rpKeur7PEnWSdmZRk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./doja-cat-says-she-feels-free-after-losing-instagram-followers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Doja Cat Says She &amp;quot;Feels Free&amp;quot; After Losing Instagram Followers">&larr;
