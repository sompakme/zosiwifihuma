"I’m proud to say in the last year I directed more than I acted," she said. "Of course, naysayers say, 'You disappeared! You’re not working anymore!' I’m like, 'Well, actually, I’m doing exactly what I want to be doing, and what I always dreamt for myself at an older age in this industry."</p><p>Apart from directing, another reason why Melissa Joan Hart hasn't been acting regularly is her family. In 2003, Hart married musician Mark Wilkerson ​and together the couple has three sons — born in 2006, 2008, and 2012.</p><p>Today, Melissa Joan Hart lives in Nashville, and she makes sure that her family is her priority.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We really like to be out in the outskirts. The kids like to be out in the woods and climbing trees and catching frogs. I grew up that way, so I want them to as well," Hart said to Glamour. "The industry has changed so much. I can be anywhere and work. I’m going to direct three episodes of Young Sheldon later this season, so I’ll fly to L.A. for those and then come back. I wanted to take the year off for family except for Lifetime Christmas movies and Young Sheldon. Those were my two goals, and I got them both</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdorKttdKsmGain5a7brTAq6usZZOWv6ax0Wacp5yVmXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zach-braff-net-worth-how-much-is-zach-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zach Braff Net Worth  How Much is Zach Worth?">&larr;
