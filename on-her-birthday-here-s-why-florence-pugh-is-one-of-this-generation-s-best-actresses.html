When Pugh got to star in Little Women, she fans could see it in her eyes that she was passionate about this film's message. Additionally, Pugh always offers support to her peers, she even shared Zendaya's Emmy win as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two stars are currently filming a project together.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Olivia Wilde Says Pay Disparity Between Harry Styles And Florence Pugh Is 'Nonexistent'">Olivia Wilde Says Pay Disparity Between Harry Styles And Florence Pugh Is 'Nonexistent'</a></span></p><h2 id=her-acting-range-is-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Her Acting Range Is A Force To Be Reckoned With</span></h2><p>From horror to drama to period pieces and action, Florence Pugh has done basically all.

She was only six years old when she participated in her first ever theatrical work: she played Mary in her school's nativity play. Growing up, the actress often posted videos of her singing, and disliked her private school simply because it did not add anything to her acting passion. So, one could say, it's been a long relationship between Pugh and the limelight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-still-has-so-much-ahead-of-her><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Still Has So Much Ahead Of Her</span></h2><p>Fans often forget that Pugh is only 24, turning 25 this January.
