There have even been A-listers that have guest starred in various seasons, such as Lady Gaga, Billy Eichner, Stevie Nicks, and Adam Levine. Soon to join them will be America's biggest reality star herself, <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Biggest Stars Who've Appeared On American Horror Story</a></span></p><p>The socialite has plenty of on-screen experience thanks to her reality shows Keeping Up with the Kardashians and now The Kardashians, as well as making cameo appearances in various TV episodes and movies like 30 Rock, How I Met Your Mother, 2 Broke Girls, and Ocean's 8.</p><p>Her lack of scripted acting did not deter American Horror Story producers, however, as they specifically sought after Kardashian for a role in their upcoming season 12 release, American Horror Story: Delicate. Here is a look into what Kim's role will be and what other surprises the new season will have in store for us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-will-american-horror-story-season-12-be-released><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>When Will American Horror Story Season 12 Be Released?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sarah-Paulson-American-Horror-Story-Featured-Image.jpg><p>The 11th season of American Horror Story came to an end in November 2022.

With everything that is going on in each episode, the themes vary from season to season. Season 11 was subtitled as American Horror Story: NYC, since it focused on the city of New York as a subplot/character.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 12 will be titled American Horror Story: Delicate</a>. It will be the first season of the show that takes heavy inspiration from an outside source: the novel Delicate Condition by author Danielle Valentine. The book was published in August 2022, following a storyline of great thrill, suspense, and suspect.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think This Is The Worst Season Of American Horror Story</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-is-joining-the-ahs-family><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Is Joining The AHS Family</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-10.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian is taking a big step taking on a roll in American Horror Story, despite her previous experience in Hollywood. Though <a href=#>she was not meant to be the show runner for Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a>, she found herself as leading-lady anyway, proving her value in front of the camera.</p><p>When asked about why Kim Kardashian of all people was sought out for this new role, Ryan Murphy, co-creator of the series, replied, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim is among the biggest and brightest television stars</a> in the world, and we are thrilled to welcome her to the AHS family.

As of now, this is what we know: "Halley Feiffer has written a fun, stylish and ultimately <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">terrifying role especially for Kim</a>, and this season is ambitious and unlike anything we have ever done."</p><p>It is obvious that <a href=#>Kim's net worth does not need the boost</a>, so she must be excited about taking on this new challenge. The writer, Halley Feiffer, and the rest of the team began speaking with the reality star "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last summer about crafting a unique role</a> for her scripted TV debut." This likely means Kardashian will either play a villain or an intense antiheroine.</p><h2 id=who-else-is-joining-the-ahs-season-12-cast-list><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Who Else Is Joining The AHS Season 12 Cast List?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/B30561BF-02A1-48FB-99B6-15BC1C413598.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian is a big name, but she is not the only one to be joining the cast list for season 12.
