It's about talent, but it's also about blood, sweat, and probably a lot of tears. Any successful person you talk to will admit that luck plays a role, but if you don't have the determination to put the work in, you'll never become one of the top players in your field.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Add all of this to a highly competitive environment, crazy racing, and a lot of sponsorship dollars, and you get the insane world of Formula 1. Much like basketball and football, Formula 1 has the potential to create millionaires. And over the course of several decades, it most certainly has! With this in mind, we compiled a list of the 10 highest paid Formula 1 drivers of all time. Each number corresponds to the drivers' career earnings, including salaries and bonuses only. Let's get the engines started!</p><h2 id=rubens-barrichello---110-million>Rubens Barrichello - $110 Million</h2><p>This Brazilian racer has been out of the game for eight years now, but he sure deserves some rest.

At 322, he&nbsp;holds the record for most race starts in Formula One.&nbsp;Plus, he's scored the eleventh highest points total in Formula One history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Virtual Items Ever Sold</a></span></p><p>Additionally, Barrichello remains the only Formula 1 driver to have raced in four distinct tyre brands. With such an impressive record, it's no wonder his career earnings are estimated to be around $110 Million!</p><h2 id=felipe-massa---110-million>Felipe Massa - $110 Million</h2><p>Yet another racer who's originally from Brasil, Felipe Massa can give Rubens Barrichello a run for his money. He retired from Formula 1 racing at the end of the 2017 season, after being forced to postpone his original retirement date, which was set to be at the end of the previous season.</p><p>Massa has competed alongside some of the best in the Formula 1 world, including Lewis Hamilton,&nbsp;winning six races opposed to Hamilton's five wins. Overall, Felipe Massa is still one of the most successful Formula 1 racers of all time, and it shows in the bank. Much like his countryman Rubens, his career earnings come out at $110 Million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jacques-villeneuve---115-million>Jacques Villeneuve - $115 Million</h2><p>Jacques Villeneuve was born in Canada, and it's safe to say that he had the racing gene running somewhere through his body.

There's more to Villeneuve than his racing career, though. He's also an amateur musician, which he finds solace in. However, it's his racing he should thank for giving him an estimated $115 Million in career earnings. Not too shabby, not too shabby at all!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ralf-schumacher---121-million>Ralf Schumacher - $121 Million</h2><p>This German racer also comes from a family of racers, alongside his brother Michael, who also happens to feature on this list.

And while his career with Formula One officially ended in 2007 because of internal pressure, his earnings still total an incredible $121 Million.</p><h2 id=jenson-button---147-million>Jenson Button - $147 Million</h2><p>This Formula One racer is a British native who&nbsp;won the 2009 Formula One World Championship, beginning his journey when he was only eight years old.
