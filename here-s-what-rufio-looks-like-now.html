The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spielberg flick</a> might have had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">huge stars</a> in it, but the kids really stood out. In the film, Dante Basco played Rufio, who has since gone down as an iconic character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Basco has had an incredibly underrated career, so let’s take a look and see what he looks like now and what he’s up to.</p><h2 id=dante-basco-starred-as-rufio-in-lsquo-hook-rsquo>Dante Basco Starred As Rufio In ‘Hook’</h2><p>Back in 1991, Steven Spielberg and Robin Williams teamed up to bring the world Hook, which was a modern and different take on the beloved character, Peter Pan. While Williams’ Pan was the star of the film, many of the secondary characters left a major mark on audiences upon the film’s release. Perhaps no young star in the film left an impression quite like Dante Basco, who played Rufio in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to appearing in the film, Basco had some acting experience under his belt, including appearances on The Wonder Years. Hook proved to be a huge break for the young actor, and in a flash, millions of fans around the world grew familiar with him thanks to his outstanding and memorable performance in the film. Interestingly, Basco didn’t have to formally audition for the role.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the actor</a>, “I remember one day on set, I was sitting on one of the barrels by the pirate ship in the movie, and I asked Steven, ‘Hey man, you never auditioned me, how did you end up casting me?’ He told me, ‘Dante, out of all the kids we auditioned for this film, which was thousands, you were the only kid that scared me.’”</p><p>At the box office, Hook would pull in $300 million, making it a financial success.</p><p>While it did not earn the best reviews upon release, Hook has continued to endure for three decades now, and it maintains a rabid following that can quote nearly every line in the movie. Since the film’s release, Basco has gone on to do a number of projects, especially in the world of voice acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Dawson's Creek': This Is What Kerr Smith Looks Like Now</a></span></p><h2 id=he-voiced-prince-zuko-in-lsquo-the-last-airbender-rsquo>He Voiced Prince Zuko In ‘The Last Airbender’</h2><p>In the world of film, Dante Basco has remained quite busy since breaking out in Hook. The actor lent his voice to movies like A Goofy Movie, JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time, and Monster Hunters: Legends of the Guild. He also made appearances in movies like Extreme Days, Biker Boyz, and Blood and Bone. On television, Basco has done some incredible work. His time as Prince Zuko in Avatar: The Last Airbender is arguably the best work of his career, and people genuinely loved his contribution to the character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His body of voice acting work includes projects like The Proud Family, Kim Possible, The Boondocks, The Legend of Korra, and Ultimate Spider-Man. He can practically do it all behind the microphone, and his voice acting work has been outstanding.</p><p>Aside from his voice acting roles on television, Basco continues to act in front of the camera, as well. He has appeared on shows like Hawaii Five-0, Entourage, CSI: Miami, and Prime Suspect. This doesn’t even include his work in the 90s, which featured shows like Nash Bridges, Touched by an Angel, and Moesha. It is incredible to see that the man has been working consistently for 3 decades now. Basco has had an incredible career in Hollywood, and after all these years, many fans are wondering what he looks like and what he is up to.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Boy Meets World': This Is What Morgan Matthews Looks Like Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-he-looks-like-now>What He Looks Like Now</h2><p>The 45-year-old Basco is quite active on social media, and fans can catch up with him there to see what he is up to in his daily life. Things seem to be going exceptionally well for the actor, and it’s great to see that a performer who rose to stardom as a kid has made a career in entertainment and has continued to thrive.</p><p>Given his lengthy body of work, it should come as no surprise that Dante Basco has a number of projects lined up, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>. Basco is currently attached to projects like Chocolate, Underdogs Rising, Pasty Lee & The Keepers of the 5 Kingdoms, and Asian Persuasion. With all of these projects on deck, Basco will continue to thrive in Hollywood for years to come.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Andy From 'The Andy Milonakis Show' Looks Like Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hopefully, fans will get the chance to hear him in other prominent voice-acting roles moving forward.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Stars From The 2000s Now Have Adult Kids (Here's What They Look Like)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqKebYrWmvsSsZLCgkal6s8HFoqZmpJ%2BkuLR5y6KinmWepMRw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kate-middleton-looks-bright-and-beautiful-in-green-leopard-print.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Middleton Looks Bright and Beautiful in Green Leopard Print">&larr;
