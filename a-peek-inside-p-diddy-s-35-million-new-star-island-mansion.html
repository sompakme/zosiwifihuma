Apart from <a href=#>Kanye West</a> and Bow Wow, the most notorious would have to be the Bad Boy record mogul, P. Diddy, better known as Diddy Love. Aside from gaining international fame from his signing of the late multi-million dollar hip-hop artist, Biggie Smalls, Diddy has gone on to invest in other entrepreneurial ventures, including his own clothing brand, Sean John, a thriving vodka brand called Ciroc, his own high-performance water brand called AQUAhydrate, a 50% stake in the Deleon tequila brand, as well as a few acting gigs. All of these business-savvy investments have grown his net worth to $900 million, making him one of the wealthiest entertainers in the world! In addition to his lumpsum of cash, Diddy Love also has an extensive list of pricey <a href=#>real estate homes</a>, his most recent being a $35 million mansion on Star Island, off the coast of Miami. Let's check out the interior design and architectural genius that put such a price tag on this mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=diddy-s-love-estate>Diddy's 'Love' Estate</h2><p>If there's one thing fans and celebrities alike have come to know about Diddy is that he's flamboyant. From his fancy clothes and premium jewelry to the parties he hosts, it's all done to the extreme. So when he caught wind of "Nena's Villa," a mansion once belonging to Cuban singer and actress, <a href=#>Gloria Estefan</a>, on the market for $35 million, he jumped at the opportunity. The Latin music giants also made a killing on the returns from their purchase of the mansion in 1993, where they spent only $1.8 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The property was first put on the market in 2015 where the original price was $40 million. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, it was last listed in 2019 for $32 million, until in July 2021, Diddy settled the score with $35 million. And, being the visionary he is, the Bad Boy record label owner conveniently snagged up the mansion right next to his original 13,000 square foot mega-mansion estate which he purchased back in 2003 for over $14 million. It's been rumored that he plans to combine both properties into one mega estate, which would easily put Hugh Hefner's <a href=#>Playboy Mansion</a> to an open shame.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Diddy Bids Farewell To His Multi-Million-Dollar LA Mansion</a></span></p><h2 id=shining-on-the-star-island>Shining On The Star Island</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sitting on 1.3 acres of land in the exclusive Star Island community, the mansion measures 8,000 square feet. The exterior of the home features a crisp white painting from the entrance gate to the main structure and is complemented by large, lush palm trees in the center court and other foliage spread out through the surrounding area. Inside the magnificent structure can be found six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, perfect for the large company of guests the Monster's Ball actor often invites over for raving parties.</p><p>The white-themed decor can also be seen on the entire inside of the structure which greatly accessories and brightens the interior from the sun and water encircling the property. With upgraded hardwood and marble flooring throughout the home, it's enough to make <a href=#>Josh Brolin's modest Atlanta mansion</a> look like a little house on the prairie. One of the living rooms is extremely spacious, lit with built-in ceiling lights and a broad white fireplace, arched doorways, and a large window space to allow all that natural sunshine to burst in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're feeling hungry, we're heading into the kitchen area which is also tremendously spacious, decked with shimmering marble floors and a long center island. Keeping the same white scheme on the interior, there is also a built-in countertop stove beside a large kitchen sink, an overhead pot rack, and a ton of cupboard space. I bet Diddy won't have any trouble storing away his crated of Ciroc Vodka or his <a href=#>tequila brand.</a></p><h2 id=additional-rooms-and-outdoor-leisure>Additional Rooms And Outdoor Leisure</h2><p>Now, this next room may be appreciated more by a celebrity like John Legend or <a href=#>Alicia Keys</a>, who actually play the piano. Other features in the house include an open piano room, perfect for some quiet time and reflection after a night of indulgent celebrity partying. Heading upstairs, there is a second-floor loft, and available in nearly every room are individual terraces, each providing its own views of the water. When you're on Star Island, you won't be able to tell the difference between waking up in Miami and being on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp's private island</a> in<a href=#> the Bahamas.</a> The scenic view is just that refreshing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 1940-home build also features open patio spaces that connect around to the back courtyard where you'll find a tiled hot tub and classy, resort-style pool and spa located not too far from the 240 ft waterfront. Rivaling only another party animal like Drake and his YOLO Estate, Diddy's second Star Island estate also boasts a separate two-story guesthouse toward the front of the property, fitted with three bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accommodate his buddies like French Montana and Usher.</a></p><p>A large part of Sean Combs' fortune can be attributed to his massive<a href=#> real estate portfolio</a>. He once owned a $4 million 3.5-acre estate in New Jersey which he sold in 2016 for $5.5 million. In addition, he owns a 17,000 square-foot mansion worth $39 million in Los Angeles, and a $5.25 million home which he purchased in 2009 for his now deceased, Kim Porter. He has not sold the home since her passing in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Combs Enterprises: 5 Ways Sean 'Diddy' Combs' Net Worth Surged To $885 Million</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirror</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCasqx5yKeqopyVYr1usMidm7KrXWiCbrnIpaOip55iu6bDjKyrmqpdnsCtrc2dZKaZnqi2sLqO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./azzyland-wiki-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Azzyland Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More">&larr;
