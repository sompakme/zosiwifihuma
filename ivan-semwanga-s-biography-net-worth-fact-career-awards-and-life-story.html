He moved to South Africa for greener pastures, and it is alleged that Ivan worked as a ritualist in a local shrine in South Africa. He was helping rich South Africans to solve their problems by dumping them on the ground and giving them holy water that would wash their problems away. This helped Ivan accumulate his wealth and by the time of his death, he had made a fortune with multimillion Business Empire which included Schools (In South Africa), students’ hostels, and apartments among others. Ivan was christened the ‘modern father of Showbiz’ in Uganda because he gave a new look to the socialite scene. All the current socialites in Uganda learnt the game from Ivan. Ivan married Zari and they have three boys together. In 2011, the couple organised a traditional introduction ceremony which cost over a billion Uganda shillings. A few years later, the couple called it quits after Zari accused Ivan of domestic violence. Zari is currently married to a Tanzanian Musician called Diamond Platnumz.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=achievements></span>Achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ivan started the Brooklyn Colleges which have 6 branches spread across Durban, Pretoria and Johannesburg. The colleges specialize in Information Technology, Mining and Policing services among others. In Uganda, Ivan was constructing a hotel on Sir Apollo Kagwa road. He has several houses in Bunga, Munyonyo and Mutungo. A combination of all those projects leaves him with over Shs700m profits per month. Ivan also had two main houses in Sandton and Pretoria.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=philanthropy></span>Philanthropy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ivan was considered to be the chairman of Ugandans in South Africa. He helped several needy people in both South Africa and Uganda. Three weeks before his death, he visited the under-privileged kids in M-Lisa orphanage, Nsambya. On his visit, he donated household items like bags of rice, sugar, soap, cooking oil and many other basic needs to the orphans. He also gave each orphan Shs20, 000 before returning to South Africa where he passed on.</p><p>Ivan gave the Uganda Cranes Shs10m in cash and promised Shs5m for all the goals scored during African cup of Nations 2017. With in 90minutes, the Uganda Cranes beat the African Champions before they crossed to a penalty shoot-out. Ivan sponsored 10 fans with all expenses from South Africa to Uganda to watch the Uganda VS Zambia game live at Mandela National Stadium (Namboole).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=death></span>Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ivan suffered a heart attack after leaving Uganda. Before his departure to South Africa, Ivan helped the disadvantaged children in Nsambya and then concluded with Blankets & Wines event together with the rich gang members. Ivan was in a critical condition at Steve Biko Hospital, Pretoria South Africa where his ex-wife; Zari took care of him. Ivan died on Thursday, 25 May 2017 morning.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=burial></span>Burial<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The body of the deceased was brought back to Uganda on 28 May 2017(Sunday). A vigil was held at his home in Muyenga,Uganda that night. Ivan’s body was then taken to Namirembe Cathedral on 29 May 2017 (Monday) for church prayers before he was be taken to Kayunga for burial. Ivan was buried on 30 May 2017(Tuesday) in his ancestral home in Kayunga, Uganda. When still alive, Ivan would throw parties where he would throw notes of South Africa Rands, Uganda Shillings and US Dollars to people. The same trick was used by the remaining Rich gang members while burying him. So, instead of throwing handfuls of dust into his grave as it is in the Christian tradition, the Rich gang members tossed of notes of South Africa Rands, Uganda Shillings and US Dollars and Champagne in his grave. Concerned citizens; Abey Mgugu and Gideon Tugume dragged A-Plus funeral management and Bank of Uganda to the High Court seeking orders that the body of late Ivan Ssemwanga should be exhumed and all the currency notes that were buried with him removed. They argued that the money was being misused since it is a legal tender. Therefore they wanted it to be removed and brought back for the purpose of fulfilling its use. They continuously argued that the currency of Uganda and other nations like South Africa and the United States of America should be respected and not end up being buried. In response, the Bank of Uganda wrote a document stating that; it is no longer interested in retrieving the money buried in the grave as the money no longer serves its purpose. They stated that the money was mishandled but then it is likely to be defaced, soiled or damaged and so it will no longer serve the purpose for which it was intended.</p><p>Further more, amendments were made to the Bank of Uganda Act because the previous one didn’t state penalizing some one who defies paper money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fnsOiuoysnKavkaO0onnBoqagqpGltbp5xZqarWWTlr%2BmsdFmmLCZopnAbrrErWSwp6KptW6tzZ1kpaGWmnq0wM6rsGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./movie-stars-who-have-been-digitally-de-aged-robert-de-niro-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Movie Stars Who Have Been Digitally De-Aged: Robert De Niro, More">&larr;
