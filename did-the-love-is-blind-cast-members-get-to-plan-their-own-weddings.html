It's sweet to know that Lauren and Cameron are still married and have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gotten a dog and written a book</a>. And Amber and Barnett are also still happily together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first season brought up questions of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whether the series is real or fake</a>&nbsp;and one of the most talked-about aspects of the series is, of course, the weddings. Everything led up to the big moment when the couples said "I do" or went their separate ways.</p><p>Did the cast members get to plan&nbsp;their own weddings? Let's take a look at this process.</p><h2 id=lauren-and-cameron-s-wedding>Lauren And Cameron's Wedding</h2><p>When watching the finale of&nbsp;Love Is Blind, it seemed like all the weddings looked very similar. According to&nbsp;Hello Magazine, there were two different venues that were used:&nbsp;The Estate by Legendary, or Flourish Atlanta.</p><p>Couples can get married inside or outside at&nbsp;The Estate by Legendary Events and this is where the brides and grooms could do their hair and prepare for their big day.</p><p>While the couples had to go with these venues, it sounds like they could pick some other things, which is great news since weddings can feel very personal and subjective.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans love Lauren and Cameron's relationship</a>&nbsp;and it's fun to learn more about their wedding day, which seemed very romantic.</p><p>Fans are curious if the couples actually got to plan their own weddings and it turns out that the answer was yes. Cameron Hamilton and Lauren Speed said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they could make wedding-related decisions</a>.</p><p>Cameron said,&nbsp;"The decisions were super accelerated. So one day it's cake, the next day it's the decorations or whatever, the next day it's the wedding rings. It was back-to-back-to-back," according to&nbsp;Buzzfeed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lauren explained,&nbsp;"We got to choose things like the type of flowers we wanted, the color scheme, our wedding dresses and bridesmaids dresses. We had a nice amount of say on what we wanted it to look like. We didn't pick the venue, but it turned out great!"</p><p>Lauren told&nbsp;The Knot News that she cared about the color used:&nbsp;"I had to have my color scheme. I wanted there to be a splash of color with the purple and pinks. The music and the drinks were very important to me and have fun. Those were my main things." She also seemed happy with the venue: "The venue was the Estate. Very beautiful, one of the older mansion estates. It was super classy and super beautiful.”</p><p>In an interview with&nbsp;People, Lauren said that it would be nice to have another wedding that family members could come to.</p><p><span class=related-single style=color:#000>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About ‘The Celebrity Dating Game’</a></span></p><h2 id=amber-and-barnett>Amber And Barnett</h2><p>Amber Pike and Matt Barnett are another couple who still remain married after meeting on&nbsp;Love Is Blind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on what Lauren and Cameron said, it sounds like this couple got to make a few wedding decisions, too, but the venue was chosen for them.</p><p>Amber also said it would be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">great to have a second wedding</a>. In an interview with&nbsp;People, she talked about how thrilled they are to be together and she said,&nbsp;“I would love to do another wedding. There’s no rush on it. We’re married now, but at some point.” She would love to experience&nbsp;traditional wedding planning milestones: Amber said, "But I do want to get to do a bridal shower with my family and my bachelorette trip with people I actually love and who have partied with me before.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix’s ‘The Circle’: What Is The Cast Of Season 1 Up To Now?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-cost-of-the-weddings>The Cost Of The&nbsp;Weddings</h2><p>Chris Coelen, the creator of&nbsp;Love Is Blind, explained&nbsp;that the couples did pay for some wedding stuff themselves. He said,&nbsp;"Of course production supplies some of the basics but because these are their real weddings, it's up to them as to how to spend their money," according to&nbsp;Women's Health.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amber did answer a comment on her social media, though, and say, "the weddings were 100 percent paid for by the show."&nbsp;Women's Health&nbsp;pointed out that viewers weren't certain what was true, as she had to pay $850 to get her wedding dress altered, and she was upset about that.</p><p>Based on Coelen's explanation, it seems like the show did cover some costs and the couples were responsible for some aspects, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s What These ‘Love Is Blind’ Fan-Favorites Are Up To Now</a></span></p><p>Planning a wedding, whether IRL away from cameras or as part of a reality TV show finale,&nbsp;is definitely a tough and stressful process.
