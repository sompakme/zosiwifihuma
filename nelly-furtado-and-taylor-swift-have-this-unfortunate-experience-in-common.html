Taylor only seems to be increasing her fame and fortune exponentially, while Nelly Furtado hit peak fame in the early 2000s but <a href=#>has since opted to fly under the radar</a>. But the two artists have at least one thing in common, even though they probably wish they didn't.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-tends-to-fight-back-against-critics-and-worse>Taylor Tends To Fight Back Against Critics And Worse</h2><p>Fans of Ms. Swift know she likes a good clap back. But not all of her retorts to criticism come through carefully penned lyrics. At least, not when things get serious.</p><p>In 2013, Taylor alleged that a DJ named David Mueller assaulted her during a meet-and-greet event. Her account stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mueller reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end</a>.</p><p>Mueller was later fired from his "dream job," and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sued Taylor in 2015</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Was This Taylor Swift Conspiracy An Elaborate Way Of Selling Merch? ">Was This Taylor Swift Conspiracy An Elaborate Way Of Selling Merch?</a></span></p><p>While testifying in court years later, Taylor detailed her accusations and defended her account, saying, "He did not touch my rib, he did not touch my arm…he grabbed my bare a**."</p><p>In response to Mueller's lawyer's suggestion that Taylor wanted to get the DJ fired, she responded, "I think what he did was despicable, horrifying, shocking, but I don’t know him at all."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued, "I didn’t have a reaction to a strange person I didn’t know losing his job…that was a product of his decisions, not mine."</p><h2 id=taylor-sought-a-1-verdict-in-the-trial>Taylor Sought A $1 Verdict In The Trial</h2><p>Though she wasn't afraid to speak up in court, Taylor Swift didn't originally sue David Mueller. According to People, Mueller said he was banned from Taylor Swift concerts "for life," in addition to being fired from his DJ gig. But the court case only came when Mueller filed suit.</p><p>It wasn't the first time Taylor had been sued (she's previously <a href=#>been taken to court over a book</a> and <a href=#>song lyric copyright issues</a>), but it might have been the first time she was sued for apparently ruining someone's reputation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Mueller's part, his lawyer said, "Mueller has been hurt and wants his good name back and he wants to be fairly compensated for income he lost and ability to earn income in the future."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How Taylor Swift's 2023 Tour Broke Records As Soon As It Was Announced">How Taylor Swift's 2023 Tour Broke Records As Soon As It Was Announced</a></span></p><p>Taylor only sought a $1 verdict in the countersuit, her attorney explained, because she didn't want to "bankrupt this man."</p><p>Swift's attorney's statements elaborated that she chose to stand up and speak out because women are "entitled to not have [assault] happen" to them, while Mueller's side concentrated on their attempts to restore the former DJ's reputation.</p><p>Throughout the trial, many celebrities spoke up about their support for Taylor, including one who had a surprisingly similar experience during her rise to fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nelly-furtado-publicly-supported-taylor-and-related-a-similar-experience>Nelly Furtado Publicly Supported Taylor, And Related A Similar Experience</h2><p>Nelly Furtado may not have made headlines or headed to court the way Taylor did, but it seems she experienced similar treatment in the industry. In a tweet, Nelly wrote, "Been in several meet n' greets where radio staff attempt to cross lines."</p><p>She praised Taylor for "fighting 4 women's safety in the workplace," and didn't reveal further details.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Nelly Furtado Fans Were Suprised To Learn That Her Baby Daddy Still Works In The Industry">Nelly Furtado Fans Were Suprised To Learn That Her Baby Daddy Still Works In The Industry</a></span></p><p>Furtado, who rocketed to fame in 2000 with "I'm Like a Bird," no doubt had many experiences similar to Taylor's with meeting fans, collaborating with other artists, and attending industry events.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And despite songs like "Promiscuous Girl," Nelly was a bit more reserved than other stars; <a href=#>she once turned down a Playboy offer</a> and also welcomed a child not long after she broke into the mainstream.</p><p>However, her statement in support of Taylor makes it clear that Nelly experienced unwelcome advances from radio staff as well, but that she apparently never spoke up about it.</p><p>Times may have been different then, or, possibly Nelly didn't feel she had the reputation or power to fight back. But Taylor, nearly a decade later, did, and fans and fellow artists praised her for it.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-the-man-who-assaulted-taylor-swift>What Happened To The Man Who Assaulted Taylor Swift?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for the disgraced former DJ, a 2018 interview with Entertainment Tonight suggests he changed his story after losing the trial. During the trial, he alleged that the groping incident was an accident.</p><p>Years later, he claimed it was his boss that had assaulted Taylor, not him, and that the singer mixed the two up. Fans commenting on the recorded interview scoffed at the change in his story. They suggested that he realized he'd made a mistake in trying to sue Taylor, but it was too late, so he changed his story to try and backtrack.</p><p>As of 2018, David Mueller had been hired at another radio station (KIX 92.7 in Mississippi), where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his boss said he believed Mueller was innocent</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lo6qypXnFqKlmnJWbrq6t06Kmp2WilrGqu4ydoWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./peter-jones-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peter Jones Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
