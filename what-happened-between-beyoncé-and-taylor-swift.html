I can’t see them — I’m just assuming that this whole thing was a practiced and rehearsed skit because why else would Kanye West be jumping up on the stage, interrupting Taylor Swift?"</p><p>Lautner said that while he laughed at first, he soon realized it "wasn't good" when Swift turned around and he saw her face.</p><p>Later in the show, Beyoncé won Video of the Year for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)." Instead of giving a speech herself, Beyoncé invited Swift on stage to redo her speech.</p><p>"I remember being 17 years old, up for my first MTV award with Destiny's Child and it was one of the most exciting moments of my life," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé said</a>, "so I would like for Taylor to come out and have her moment."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:05</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-many-songs-has-taylor-swift-written-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?">How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has penned plenty of hits, but how many songs has she actually written in total?</p><p>Swift then walked on stage, gave Beyoncé a hug, and properly accepted the award for her "You Belong With Me" video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the show, Swift spoke with reporters about the support Beyoncé showed her that night.</p><p>"It was so wonderful and gracious of her," Swift said.

While speaking to KissFMUK ahead of the big night, Swift shared her love for the singer.</p><p>"It’s like, normal for everyone to love Beyoncé, but I love her more than that amount, like more than the normal amount," Swift said. "I try really hard not to let it get creepy. I just really like, channel it into a joyous admiration and appreciation."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar52728356.jpg><p>She continued, "I'm nominated usually against lots of my friends, so you have to — just for the sake of humanity and for the sake of having a good time — legitimately be happy for other people."</p><p>Swift then said that she didn't care if she won the award, she just wanted to see Beyoncé.</p><p>"The only way that I'll be upset, is if we don't get to see Beyoncé," Swift said. "I won't be upset because I didn't win. I'll just be like, 'I wish that we could see her all the time.'"</p><p>In 2021, Beyoncé broke the record for the most Grammy wins by a female artist. That same year, Swift won Album of the Year for "Folklore." This made Swift the first female artist to win the award three times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyoncé showed Swift some love by sending her flowers and a note congratulating her.
