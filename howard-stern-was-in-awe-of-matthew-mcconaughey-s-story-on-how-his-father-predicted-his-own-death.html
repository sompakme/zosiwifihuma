That's also aided by the fact that Stern has some great guests, like Matthew McConaughey. During this particular chat, Stern was blown away on how Matthew's father called his death prior to it taking place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McConaughey said during the interview, "He said boys, when I go, I'm going to be making love to your mother... He called his shot. 6:30 AM on a Monday morning." Stern replies, "Don't you think there's something cosmic about? He knew how he was going to die and he actually did it."</p><p>McConaughey also revealed that his mom told the paramedics to take the sheet off of him, so the neighbors could see just how "big" he was...
