Vandergrift, 54 years old, was last seen around 10 pm on February 23, 2023, near his home in the 200 block of King Street in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p><p>There was no detectable activity on his phone, and there was no activity on his credit cards or financial records, according to a Monday update from Wild 94.9 on the investigation.&nbsp;</p><p>He is approximately 6 feet tall, bald, and has brown eyes. He is 180 pounds, with several tattoos on both his arms and above his right ear. He was last seen wearing black sweatpants.</p><p>There are no updates on Vandergrift’s movement, and he remains missing, causing concern among his fans.&nbsp;</p><p>His Twitter page’s most recent <a href=#>social media</a> posts show his co-hosts as teenagers via a photo filter and soliciting donations for a listener whose loved one recently died.&nbsp;</p><p>His online <a href=#>biography</a> states<strong> </strong>“keep shinin’ love, compassion, understanding, truth, forgiveness, peace, and hope for others.”</p><p>Wild 94.9 put out a statement Friday saying, “we are deeply concerned” about Vandergrift’s disappearance and are working closely with SFPD and his wife to help.</p><p><strong>“We are sending love, thoughts, and prayers to JV and will share more information as we receive it,”</strong> the statement reads.</p><p>Vandergrift co-hosted the Doghouse show on KYLD during the 1990s and 2000s with Dan ‘Elvis’ Lay and Lance’ Hollywood’ Otani.&nbsp;</p><p>The show was known for its pranks, stunts, and raunchy humor. After an on-air controversy, Lay and Vandergrift relocated to New York.</p><p>In recent years, Vandergrift returned to the Bay Area with his wife, model Natasha Yi, and began hosting his JV Show on Wild 94.9.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jeffrey’s struggle with Illness and mental health</h2><p>In 2021, Vandergrift vanished from his radio show career, and there was speculation about his whereabouts.&nbsp;</p><p>During this time, doctors could not determine what was wrong with him. However, in April 2022, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with a severe Lyme disease that caused brain fog and other issues, restricting his mental and physical health.&nbsp;</p><p>Lyme disease makes it challenging for victims to carry out day-to-day activities. Vandergrift said he dealt with suicidal thoughts and promised to return to the airwaves as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>A few months ago, JV attempted to take his own life, and his wife found him in the garage, unconscious in the car. He was taken to the hospital, and once doctors discovered that Lyme disease was the primary reason for his suicidal tendencies, they started treating him.</p><p>Wild 94.9, Jeffrey JV Vandergrift wrote that he was someone who had suffered every day from the severe effects of what Lyme and other pathogens have done to his brain since the vaccine activated them.&nbsp;</p><p>Like most “Lyme” patients, he looked and sounded fine on the outside. He goes to work every day in hopes that the treatment he has sought out on his own will eventually make this nightmare come to an end.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC21WabqJ%2BYpMK0sYymoKyrmaO0bsHNq5ivnZyeu6h506GcZqWpqMGmvthmpp9lopaxqruMqZyrq5%2Bjrq2107Jm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./red-skelton-obituary-what-was-red-skelton-cause-of-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Red Skelton Obituary, What was Red Skelton Cause of Death?">&larr;
