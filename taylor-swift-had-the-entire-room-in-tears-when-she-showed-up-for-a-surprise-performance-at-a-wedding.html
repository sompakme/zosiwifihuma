The reaction from the fans was priceless.</p><p>In addition, Swift also had fans completely emotional when she showed up at a wedding. Swift received a letter from the groom's sister. Swift was so touched by the story that she decided to show up, and it caused quite a reaction from those at the venue, and fans around the world.</p><p>We'll take a closer look at how it all went down, and why Swift was asked to play Blank Space at the wedding. In addition, we're going to take a look at the other times Swift appeared at a wedding, and how she received a different reaction during another wedding experience.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Biggest Sponsorship Deal Worth $100 Million Vanished After The Artist's Team Had Finally Agreed To Terms</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-had-the-guests-in-complete-shock-when-she-crashed-the-wedding-with-a-memorable-performance>Taylor Swift Had The Guests In Complete Shock When She Crashed The Wedding With A Memorable Performance</h2><p>It was like a movie scene. The groom's sister reads her speech and then, suddenly, out of nowhere, Taylor Swift appears and heads towards a piano. The immediate reaction wasn't excitement, instead it was stunned silence. Once the guests got over the shock, it was pure joy from everyone at the wedding, particularly the bride and groom.</p><p>Once Taylor starts playing, the bride and groom head towards the artist and take part in a memorable dance to the song, Blank Space (we'll have more on why that song was chosen later). Swift was having some fun as well, telling the audience she never expected to perform that particular song at a wedding during a surprise appearance.</p><p>The video went viral, viewed by millions of fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Taylor Swift Was Clearly Uncomfortable When Jimmy Fallon Went Off-Script And Showed Footage She Wasn't Expecting</a></span></p><p>The reaction was nothing but positive in the comments section of the video.</p><p>One fan wrote, "I love that she does stuff like this.
