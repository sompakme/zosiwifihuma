Seinfeld and Friends – both considered two of the greatest shows of all time in the genre – had the better part of their respective runs on TV during the decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Everybody Loves Raymond and Married With Children are other examples of some of the <a href=#>most amazing sitcoms from the ‘90s</a>. ABC had their very own version of a classic comedy titled Boy Meets World, which they broadcast between 1993 and 2000.</p><p>The main protagonist of the show was known as Cory Matthews, whose life the series tracked from his days in elementary school all the way to the time he started a family of his own. That character was portrayed by actor Ben Savage.</p><p>William Daniels, Will Friedle, Danielle Fishel and Trina McGee were all part of <a href=#>the Boy Meets World cast</a> as well. Like many other shows in its time, the Michael Jacobs and April Kelly series often <a href=#>tackled real-life issues</a> like sexual abuse, addiction and relationship problems.</p><p>McGee has been one of the <a href=#>cast members to make brutal confessions</a> about their time on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Famous People Who Made Appearances On 'Boy Meets World'</a></span></p><h2 id=what-character-did-trina-mcgee-play-in-boy-meets-world><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Character Did Trina McGee Play In Boy Meets World?</span></h2><p>Trina McGee only joined the cast of Boy Meets World in Season 5 as a recurring character, before she was promoted to be a regular in the final two seasons of the show.</p><p>The actress was given the role of Angela Moore, who was best friends with Danielle Fishel’s Topanga Lawrence in college.

Years after the show had ended, the actress revealed that she had been the subject of <a href=#>racist behavior from some of her co-stars</a>, with Will Friedle, Danielle Fishel and Ben Savage being implicated.</p><p>McGee did say, however, that the first two had apologized for their actions.</p><h2 id=trina-mcgee-did-not-appear-in-the-boy-meets-world-series-finale><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Trina McGee Did Not Appear In The Boy Meets World Series Finale</span></h2><p>Trina McGee’s character was last involved in the penultimate episode of the show.
