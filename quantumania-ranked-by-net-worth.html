The recently released superhero film features the return of fan-favorite characters such as Scott Lang, Hope van Dyne, Hank Pym, and Janet van Dyne, but the most anticipated newcomers are Kathryn Newton as Cassie Lang and Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror.</p><p>In the film, the superheroes explore the Quantum Realm while encountering new adversaries and much more challenging scenarios than ever before. The following is a ranking of the main characters in <a href=#>Ant-Man</a> and the Wasp: Quantumania according to their net worth, as the film features a large ensemble cast.</p><h2 id=kathryn-newton-1-million>Kathryn Newton ($1 Million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kathryn Newton plays Cassie Lang, a pivotal supporting part, in Quantumania, which offers her a considerable boost to her popularity. She has been acting in films and television programs since she was four years old, including Supernatural, Lady Bird, Big Little Lies, Detective Pikachu, and more, competing with some of Hollywood's most prominent actors. There is some dispute over her net worth, but it is estimated to be around $1 million, and it will undoubtedly increase as her MCU role garners her a great deal of fame.</p><h2 id=jonathan-majors-2-million>Jonathan Majors ($2 Million)</h2><p>In Quantumania, Jonathan Majors plays <a href=#>Kang the Conqueror</a>, the primary antagonist, a role that has already generated enormous buzz in the months preceding the film's release. With another anticipated performance in Creed III on the horizon, Majors is poised to dominate this decade. While you may have seen his face everywhere in recent years, Jonathan Majors has only been an actor since 2017 and has amassed an incredible $2 million in net worth. Due to his acclaimed performances in The Harder They Fall, Lovecraft County, Da 5 Bloods, and Devotion, among other films, Majors has already established himself as one of the most gifted actors of his time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of ‘The Rings Of Power’, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=corey-stoll-3-million>Corey Stoll ($3 Million)</h2><p>Corey Stoll has been an actor since 2001, so it's not surprising that after two decades of great work, he has a comfortable net worth of $3 million. In <a href=#>House of Cards</a>, he portrayed Congressman Peter Russo, and in Billions, he portrayed Michael Prince. He previously portrayed Darren Cross or Yellowjacket in the first Ant-Man film, but in Quantumania he plays the popular Marvel Comics villain M.O.D.O.K.</p><h2 id=william-jackson-harper-4-million>William Jackson Harper ($4 Million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>William Jackson Harper will portray the telepath Quaz in the forthcoming film, and fans will undoubtedly know the outstanding actor. As a result of his Emmy-nominated performance as Chidi Anagonye in The Good Place, his major role in the TV mystery comedy The Resort, and his numerous voice performances, Harper has amassed a net worth of $4 million. In addition to his profession as an actor and voice actor, he is also a renowned playwright.</p><h2 id=randall-park-5-million>Randall Park ($5 Million)</h2><p>Fans praised Randall Park's performance of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Agent Jimmy Woo</a> in Ant-Man and the Wasp, praising his on-screen interactions with Paul Rudd's Scott Lang. To the delight of fans, the actor resumed his part in WandaVision and reprises his role as the Agent in Quantumania. Park's net worth has increased to a cool $5 million as a result of his starring position in the comedy Fresh Off the Boat and his other comic roles in prominent films and television shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=evangeline-lilly-5-million>Evangeline Lilly ($5 Million)</h2><p>Evangeline Lilly became one of the most recognizable faces of the late 2000s for her role as Kate Austen in the famous and wildly successful science-fiction drama Lost. At the conclusion of the series, her career appeared to slow down, but she had a reasonably good run in the 2010s, appearing in big franchises such as The Hobbit and now Ant-Man. She reprises her role as Hope van Dyne, or Wasp, in the new <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU Phase Five</a> film's first installment. Her net worth is around $5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Net Worth Of The Cast Of Netflix’s 'Wednesday', Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=paul-rudd-70-million>Paul Rudd ($70 Million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is difficult not to enjoy Paul Rudd, who exemplifies the common gentleman. He has starred in numerous comedy classics, constantly has a smile on his face, and has fought off claims that he is a vampire for the past two decades. Rudd is one of the most recognized performers in Hollywood, therefore it is not surprising that he has a net worth of $70 million. In Quantumania, he makes his fifth appearance as Scott Lang or Ant-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><h2 id=bill-murray-180-million>Bill Murray ($180 Million)</h2><p><a href=#>Bill Murray</a>, a comedy staple in Hollywood, requires no introduction. In Quantumania, he portrays the secondary antagonist Lord Krylar, the ruler of the Axia community in the Quantum Realm. With a career spanning five decades and several accolades for his extensive body of work, Murray's net worth is estimated to be $180 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michelle-pfeiffer-250-million>Michelle Pfeiffer ($250 Million)</h2><p>Michelle Pfeiffer, who has a whopping $250 million to her credit, has one the second-highest net worth of all celebrities in the movie. It is not surprising, though, given she is one of the most acclaimed actors of all time, with a distinguished four-decade career. Pfeiffer has deftly transitioned into even more engaging roles in the 2010s and 2020s, after capturing the world's affection in the 1980s and 1990s with roles in projects spanning all genres. In the newly released Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, <a href=#>Michelle Pfeiffer</a> reprises her role as Janet van Dyne or Wasp.</p><h2 id=michael-douglas-350-million>Michael Douglas ($350 Million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Douglas has the highest net worth among the cast members of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, with a wealth of $350 million. The two-time Oscar winner has been a prolific performer since the mid-1960s, making him one of the most successful actors of all time. Douglas also has a substantial real estate portfolio, consisting of various properties located throughout the country. Douglas may very well be the real Hank Pym, given his access to millions of dollars.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Superheroes Ever, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marca</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMnJisrF2ks26tza1kppmeYq6vsIytn55lp5bAsXnQrpinrKWirq%2B1wGapmqabmrFurthmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rose-leslie-boyfriend-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-measurements.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rose Leslie: Boyfriend, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body measurements">&larr;
