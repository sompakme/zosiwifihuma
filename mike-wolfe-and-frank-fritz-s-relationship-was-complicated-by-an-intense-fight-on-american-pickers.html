They watch their favorite reality TV stars make a lot of money by buying other people's valuable items and want the same thing for themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What viewers sometimes forget, however, is how much knowledge it takes to identify which items are good investments and which ones will lose money. In fact, even people who've spent years learning what has value can make costly mistakes.</p><p>Unfortunately for American Pickers stars Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz, their show has sometimes proven how easy it can be to lose money. On one occasion, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fritz and Wolfe got into a fight when one of them cost them a lot of money</a></strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/American-Pickers-Frank-Fritz-Featured-Image.jpg><p>In May 2024, an episode of American Pickers aired which showed memorable moments from the show's past. One of the featured scenes was from a 2010 American Pickers episode that <strong>showed Wolfe and Fritz getting into an argument</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During one of the duo's picks, Fritz spotted a vintage Plymouth Coupe that had been stored in the same place for decades. Something about the vehicle and its engine really caught Fritz's fancy so he offered the owner $5,500.</p><p>In 1928, the Chrysler Corporation launched the Plymouth brand to compete with Chevrolet and Ford. The brand stuck around for decades until it was abandoned in 2001.</p><p>Even though the vehicle had been sitting for many years, the owner was reluctant to sell. Still, <strong>Fritz was persistent and bought the Plymouth Coupe for $5,5000</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/survivor-star-jaime-huffman-romance-with-husband-erik-huffman-comes_gr-1b.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Survivor Star Jaime Huffman's Romance With Husband Erik Huffman Comes To A Crashing End With Her Damning Allegations">Survivor Star Jaime Huffman's Romance With Husband Erik Huffman Comes To A Crashing End With Her Damning Allegations</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Survivor stars Jaime Huffman and Erik Huffman fell in love on the show but their marriage fell apart amid disturbing allegations.</p><p>From the moment that Fritz began trying to buy the Plymouth Coupe, viewers saw <strong>Wolfe expressing his skepticism</strong>. "Whoa. All of a sudden he's spending our money and I'm like, "What the hell is he talking about it? What car? Why is he interested in it?"'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Wolfe, his instincts about the vehicle proved to be spot on. After the Plymouth Coupe was theirs, Fritz and Wolfe took the vehicle to their trusted expert, Dave Ohrt. Sadly, Ohrt definitely didn't have good news for the American Pickers stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/american-picker-s-frank-fritz-before-his-exit.jpg><p>After Ohrt examined the Plymouth Coupe, he told Fritz and Wolfe that <strong>the vehicle was worth less than they paid for it</strong>. According to Ohrt, <strong>the Plymouth Coupe was worth between $3,000 and $5,000</strong> in the state it was bought in.</p><p>Worse yet, Ohrt stated his opinion that <strong>Fritz and Wolfe would lose more money if they restored the vehicle</strong>.</p><p>"'I see it's in very good condition, but if you did a ground up restoration on it, you're going to put more into it than it's worth, in my opinion."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/27512.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Top Chef Head Judge Tom Colicchio's Feud With A Former Competitor Got Shockingly Personal As They Insulted His Food">Top Chef Head Judge Tom Colicchio's Feud With A Former Competitor Got Shockingly Personal As They Insulted His Food</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Top Chef Head Judge Tom Colicchio had an eliminated competitor call him out and insult his food.</p><p>Of course, it is very easy to understand why Wolfe and Fritz would be upset to learn Ohrt's assessment of the Plymouth Coupe. What fans may not have expected. however, was <strong>how angry Wolfe seemed to be about Fritz's ill-considered purchase</strong>.</p><p>How much money are the stars of American Picker's original stars worth, according to Celebrity Net Worth?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Star:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Net Worth:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Danielle Colby</p></td><td><p>$1.5 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Frank Fritz</p></td><td><p>$6 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mike Wolfe</p></td><td><p>$7 Million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As Wolfe explained, his "heart sank" when he learned Ohrt's opinion. Wolfe then went on to state in a confessional that <strong>Fritz needed to learn his lesson</strong>.</p><p>"That car was a bust. He [Frank] needs to learn he cannot have everything, and he needs to learn when to walk away."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/american-picker-s-frank-fritz-and-mike-wolfe-pretending-to-fight.jpg><p>Wolfe didn't just express his frustrations to the confessional camera. He also made it obvious that he was angry when <strong>Wolfe told Fritz that he needed to fix his mistake</strong>. "If you want that car, you're going to have to call some dealers. I don't care what you do, we're not paying Danielle more hours to try and sell it, we're not paying for ads. I don't know what to do."</p><p>Wolfe also went on to make it clear his anger wasn't just related to the Plymouth Coupe. Instead, Wolfe expressed that <strong>he was angry about their dynamic in general at that moment</strong>. "You always get your own way on stuff."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fritz later gave American Pickers' viewers an update on what happened to the Plymouth Coupe. After a year and a half, <strong>Fritz hadn't sold the vehicle or its engine</strong>. That said, Fritz called the Plymouth Coupe his "baby" and revealed he'd done a lot of work on it.</p><p>"[I've had to fix] the motor, the transmission, the brakes, the radiator, the alternator, the pumps, the fuel pumps. I mean, this thing has been top to bottom."</p><h2 id=are-american-pickers-39-frank-fritz-and-mike-wolfe-really-feuding>Are American Pickers' Frank Fritz And Mike Wolfe Really Feuding?</h2><p>After the American Pickers main trio worked as a team for many years, there have been <strong>reports about Frank Fritz and Mike Wolfe feuding</strong>. In August 2023, Cinema Blend published <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a timeline of Fritz and Wolfe's so-called feud</a></strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/90-day-fiance-big-ed-hints-reveals-new-relationship-while-mourning-his-liz-woods-break-up1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="90 Day Fiance's Big Ed Reveals New Relationship While Mourning His Liz Woods Break Up">90 Day Fiance's Big Ed Reveals New Relationship While Mourning His Liz Woods Break Up</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>90 Day Fiancé's Big Ed revealed that his latest breakup with Liz Woods is different since he has gotten involved with someone new.</p><p>That timeline showed that there was no doubt that Fritz and Wolfe have had bad blood at times. For example, after Fritz took a leave of absence from American Pickers, Wolfe revealed his former co-star wouldn't be welcome back. In response, <strong>Fritz expressed his anger at Wolfe</strong> in an interview with The Sun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Mike’s statement was bulls**t, somebody wrote it out for him. We never were friends in grade school. I don’t believe in ten years he’s said five nice things to me, you know? Unless he was cutting somebody else down and we were both laughing."</p><p>Wolfe went on to also talk to The Sun about <strong>what led to Fritz's American Pickers exit</strong>. Wolfe was nowhere near as blunt as Fritz had been, but he stated that <strong>Fritz's addiction issues caused his exit</strong>. Fritz had previously revealed that he went to rehab during his voluntary leave of absence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/american-picker-s-frank-fritz-looking-happy-together.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fritz and Wolfe's unfortunate back and forth continued from there. However, the important thing to note is that the Quad-City Times later reported that <strong>the American Pickers co-stars reunited</strong>. A friend of Fritz's reportedly arranged the reunion and spoke to the Quad-City Times about <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the state of the former co-stars' relationship</a></strong>.</p><p>“This was not a feud between Mike and Frank at all. They were not feuding. They needed separation to appreciate each other.”</p><p>The article also stated that Wolfe wanted to reunite earlier, but Fritz took time to be emotionally prepared to meet. Fritz's friend also told the outlet <strong>how things went when the American Pickers stars came back together</strong>.</p><p>“They were both in tears. Both were crying. Mike brought up how nervous they both were to be going on David Letterman, which was one of their first big appearances. He said, ‘Nobody can replace you, Frank.’ He said it was Frank’s ‘uniquely funny personality’ that made them fit so well together as a team.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoqOVYsSwuMWeZJ%2BqkaO4brLRoquzZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXqntcahq2annmKurrHRopqapl2ltqS3xKuqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./peter-thomas-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peter Thomas Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
