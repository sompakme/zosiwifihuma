She got a lot of attention for her outlandish but creative outfits and for advocating for LGBTQ+ rights. Other than her music career, she is currently one of the rising stars in Hollywood. She got raves for her first major film,&nbsp;A Star Is Born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gaga has also made some headlines because of who she is currently dating...or rumored to be dating. Her relationships range from professional to romantic. While her relationships don't always last, she almost got married twice. Her relationships will always remain a part of who she is as an artist. These relationships are part of her artistic journey.</p><p>From old to new, here's a timeline of Lady Gaga's relationships.</p><h2 id=an-on-and-off-relationship><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>An On And Off Relationship</span></h2><p>One of Gaga's earliest relationships was with&nbsp;Lüc Carl. They coupled up way back in 2005, a few years before Gaga would attain 'the fame'. He was a huge inspiration on her (and on the songs she wrote), but their relationship would not last. However, they would encounter each other again, five years after the breakup.</p><h2 id=how-she-got-her-name><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>How She Got Her Name</span></h2><p>Relationships between singers and producers are surprisingly common. Rob Fusari is a music producer that has contributed to recordings for big artists, such as Destiny's Child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rob and Gaga's relationship is arguably important, as he is credited with giving her the stage name we know and love. Their relationship, however, would take a turn for the worse.</p><h2 id=so-long-rob><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>So Long, Rob</span></h2><p>In 2010, Rob <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sued</a> Gaga, and it all took place in a state court in Manhattan, NY. He stated that she ditched him as her career really started to skyrocket. Gaga would file a countersuit afterward. The lawsuits were eventually dropped the same year, in September. At this point, the two went their separate ways permanently.</p><h2 id=designer-singer-combo><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Designer/Singer Combo</span></h2><p>Gaga eventually befriended Matt Williams, who also goes by the nickname, "Dada." He became the creative director of 'The Haus of Gaga' (her personal creative team) and the two were destined to form a fast friendship that evolved into a romance!</p><p>He even helped create one of Gaga's most famous stage props, known as the Disco Stick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-million-records-earned-lost-him><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>10 Million Records Earned, Lost Him</span></h2><p>Even though Gaga called herself and Matt "crazy lovers," their romantic relationship only lasted for a year. In her documentary,&nbsp;Gaga: Five Foot Two, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> her split with him, saying that she sold ten million records but lost Matt in the process.</p><p>Not much is known about the split, but it must have been a difficult time for both of them.</p><h2 id=reunited-for-a-bit><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Reunited For A Bit</span></h2><p>In an interesting twist of fate, the producer, Lüc, that we mentioned earlier, managed to come back into Gaga's life in 2010, five years after they drifted apart. There were pics of them kissing and handing out flowers in glossy magazines.</p><p>Even though it has been ten years, it's hard to say if they were&nbsp;together or not, despite the public displays of affection.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Things Fans Don’t Know About Lady Gaga</a></span></p><h2 id=a-million-reasons><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>A Million Reasons</span></h2><p>The first of&nbsp;Gaga's&nbsp;most publicized relationships was her relationship with Taylor Kinney. It was like a sweet fairy tale with a heartbreaking, but realistic ending. The two met on the set of the music video for her song, "Yoü and I", and things got serious, but they eventually decided to part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sparks-flying><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Sparks Flying</span></h2><p>Gaga and Taylor's relationship lasted for a good five years. Any guy would have been lucky to be with the one he loved for that long, whether in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship or via marriage.</p><p>It would take them about four years until they would officially become engaged. The media was just ecstatic at the news.</p><h2 id=their-engagement><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Their Engagement</span></h2><p>In February of 2015, the whole world got the news that Lady Gaga was engaged to Chicago Fire actor, Taylor Kinney.&nbsp;Times Herald-Record executive editor,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Lewis</a>, got a live experience of her getting proposed to! This happened at&nbsp;Gaga's father's restaurant...and the place was going crazy after she showed off her engagement ring.</p><h2 id=tragic-call-off><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Tragic Call Off</span></h2><p>As with many engagements, marriage is not guaranteed. One of the most heartbreaking news 'Little Monsters' and others received was the announcement that Gaga and Taylor were breaking off their engagement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a>&nbsp;in her documentary that her career as a hugely popular singer was one of the big factors in the breakup.</p><h2 id=another-romance-budding><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Another Romance Budding</span></h2><p>Breaking off an engagement with a partner you've been with for so long is very difficult, yet Gaga managed to find her way to someone new. She encountered American fashion designer, Christian Carino, in 2017. They were seen at a Kings of Leon concert together and things heated up between them afterward.</p><h2 id=second-engagement><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Second Engagement</span></h2><p>2017 was a wild time for the two. As their relationship was getting more serious, the two became officially engaged. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apparently</a>, Christian asked for permission from Gaga's father and her dad granted it, which sounds old-fashioned in a good way.</p><p>Since Gaga was recovering from her chronic illness, fibromyalgia, they focused on her health, rather than wedding plans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=speculating-rumors><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Speculating Rumors</span></h2><p>After they got engaged, things got quiet in Gaga and Christian's relationship. They posted Instagram videos and photos now and then, but it wasn't until 2018 when Gaga confirmed the rumors of her engagement. 2019, however, would bring dramatic changes. Gaga was having romantic problems again...</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga’s Highs And Lows, In 20 Photos</a></span></p><h2 id=engagement-ring-nowhere-to-be-seen><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Engagement Ring Nowhere To Be Seen</span></h2><p>In early 2019, Gaga appeared at the Grammys, but with&nbsp;one important thing missing...her engagement ring, Christian wasn't there with her, and she accepted her award without thanking him.</p><p>The singer's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">representative</a> confirmed that they had ended their engagement. As with a lot of relationships, things don't always work out.</p><h2 id=moving-on-fast><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Moving On Fast</span></h2><p>With another engagement called off, who would be the next guy in Gaga's life? In 2019, she was linked to an audio engineer, Dan Horton. The two were seen at a brunch date and cameras were quick to catch them in the middle of PDA. Compared to her past relationships, well...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=confirming-the-unfortunate-news><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Confirming The Unfortunate News</span></h2><p>It would not take long for Gaga and Dan to call it quits, in late 2019. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;reported that Gaga broke up with him because he was too immature for her. It was a shock considering that the relationship only lasted for about three months, but that goes to show that not all relationships are meant to last forever.</p><h2 id=not-an-official-relationship-but-still-beautiful><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Not An Official Relationship, But Still Beautiful</span></h2><p>Bradley Cooper is an exception, as he and Gaga have not officially dated. However, they are a great pair, even though they aren't a romantic couple. It is easy to believe that they were so into each other when they were hanging out together. They filmed and promoted&nbsp;A Star Is Born and they did get very close.</p><h2 id=their-incredible-chemistry><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Their Incredible Chemistry</span></h2><p>The chemistry between Bradley and Gaga is undeniably stronger than steel. From the shoutouts to each other whenever A Star Is Born won an award, to performing at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscars</a>, these two were meant to meet one another. We certainly hope that these two will collaborate again in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-current-new-man><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Her Current New Man</span></h2><p>Not too long ago, Gaga treated her fans (and the world) to a look at a guy that we assume is her new beau. She posted a pic of herself with him, in Miami.&nbsp;Michael Polansky is a tech CEO that went to Harvard along with Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. How they met is through mutual friends.</p><h2 id=not-serious-but-sure-looks-like-it><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Not Serious, But Sure Looks Like It</span></h2><p>Apparently, Gaga is taking a different approach to her new relationship. As the media loves to know what's going on with her personal life, a source from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> has stated, "She’s having fun and likes the attention, but he is not the only guy she’s interested in."</p><p>Despite what sources say, if Gaga's happy, that's all it matters in the end.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga And Her New Boyfriend Make Their Romance “Insta” Official</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYZqyZorKttc2eZKieXZa5rXnOn2SlmZSueqitxpqqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoKh8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cesar-montes-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cesar Montes Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
