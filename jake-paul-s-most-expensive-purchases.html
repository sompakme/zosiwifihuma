Now Paul focuses on his vlog, and leading Team 10, a group of rowdy influencers. With almost 20 million YouTube subscribers and a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$19.5 million</a>, Jake Paul is indisputable&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;royalty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest YouTubers of All Time</a></span></p><p>It's wild just how much cash he's has amassed in such a short amount of time. Jake Paul's also known for his preference for&nbsp;super luxurious goods that come with a hefty price tag. Scroll down to check out Jake Paul's most expensive purchases.</p><h2 id=yeezys---1000>Yeezys - $1000</h2><p>People wait months to get their hands on Kanye West's trendy, minimalist, self-titled Yeezys. These sneakers have found a&nbsp;place in the wardrobes&nbsp;of&nbsp;billionaire celebrities, Instagram hype-beasts, and supermodels alike.</p><p>Jake Paul's snow-white Yeezy's, valued at over<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;$1000</a>, were customized so that they would match Paul's tie-dye merchandise collection. In 2017, Jake Paul uploaded a video of him in his bathroom, dyeing Kaye West's iconic sneakers with handheld squirt bottles. However, despite Paul's DIY decoration of these pricy shoes, they never made another appearance. Maybe he should have stuck with the monochromatic color scheme?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=west-hollywood-home---17-000-per-month>West Hollywood Home - $17,000 per month</h2><p>Before Jake Paul moved into his Calabasas mansion, he and his other Team 10 influencers rented&nbsp;a house in West Hollywood for $17,000 a month. Paul and Team 10 lived and filmed their stunts in this chic home for about a year, along the way racking up around $204,000 in rent payments.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Most Expensive Apartments in North America</a></span></p><p>However,&nbsp;Team 10's&nbsp;rowdy antics got them into hot water. Nearby residents almost filed a class-action lawsuit against Paul and his team for&nbsp;their disruption to the neighborhood. After warring with fed-up neighbors, Paul purchased&nbsp;a much more secluded (and super expensive) mansion on 3.5 acres of land.</p><h2 id=toyota-tacoma---33-300>Toyota Tacoma - $33,300</h2><p>The first of Jake Paul's four cars on the list is a customized Toyota Tacoma. This truck's price comes in at a cool $33,300 and it slides into the 7th spot of Jake Paul's most outrageous purchases. The Toyota Tacoma - a car built for serious outdoor adventuring - features a sleek interior and excellent off-road capability.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jake purchased this Tacoma in 2015 (back when he was still headlining Disney Channel's Bizaardvark). Since, Paul has taken&nbsp;the truck--&nbsp;that he calls "bae" on twitter-- on lots of outdoor adventures.</p><h2 id=bust-down-rolex---100-000>Bust Down Rolex - $100,000</h2><p>The behemoth watchmaker Rolex is known for its exclusive clientele and expensive timepieces. This diamond encrusted Bust Down Rolex was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased as a gift</a>&nbsp;by Paul for his girlfriend, Tana Mongeau.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Watch Brands</a></span></p><p>Mongeau and Paul dated for only 3 months before announcing their marriage. Their wedding ceremony in Las Vegas was streamed for $50&nbsp;for eager fans (all of whom ultimately got a refund because of the video's poor quality). It came as no surprise to many when Mongeau admitted that she and Paul&nbsp;were not officially married, and that the so-called wedding was arranged "for fun and content." Still, Paul loved to gift Mongaeu some expensive gifts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=diamond-audemars-piguet---100-000>Diamond Audemars Piguet - $100,000</h2><p>For his 21st birthday, Jake Paul gifted himself&nbsp;this impressive iced-out timepiece. The watch's body is Royal Oak Stainless Steel&nbsp;and it's covered in 18.5 Carat diamonds. With all that ice, it's no wonder this exclusive watch comes with a $100,000 price tag.</p><p>Jake Paul took to Snapchat on his birthday to flex his self-given glittering birthday gift, along with other expensive watches that members of Team 10 gifted him.</p><h2 id=mercedes-benz-g-wagen---125-000>Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen - $125,000</h2><p>For Tana Mongeau's 21st birthday, Jake Paul gifted her a black Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon with a $125,000 price tag.&nbsp;This&nbsp;gift came after he gave Tana Mongeau driving lessons in his Tesla X and the two&nbsp;joked about Mongeau receiving a car for her birthday.</p><p>However, Mongeau might have to wait a little bit before she&nbsp;hops behind&nbsp;the driver seat alone. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still doesn't have a driver's license</a>, although she creates lots of vlogs where she test drives her friends' expensive cars!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tesla-x---143-000>Tesla X - $143,000</h2><p>This sleek SUV with bird-wing doors and luxury&nbsp;finishes&nbsp;comes from one of the most innovate, respected, and exclusive car companies in the world. Like some other gifts on this list, Paul didn't&nbsp;purchase the Tesla for himself.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Tesla Model Xs Are Powerful Enough To Move Trucks Blocking Charging Stations</a></span></p><p>Instead, this $81,000 ride was purchased for his then-girlfriend, and fellow member of Team 10, Erika Costell. In 2017, his Team 10 posse filmed Paul&nbsp;going to a private Tesla showroom to buy this expensive ride.</p><h2 id=diamond-for-tana-mongeau--300-000>Diamond For Tana Mongeau- $300,000</h2><p>Jake Paul and Tana Mongeau's engagement raised a lot of eyebrows. They had been dating for only three months when they decided to get hitched and fans had a lot of doubts about the relationship's authenticity. An eagle-eyed&nbsp;social media user&nbsp;identified&nbsp;the sparkler Mongeau flaunted on her Snapchat after Paul's proposal as a&nbsp;fake diamond&nbsp;costing a mere <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$125 </a>(Remember-- Paul has a net-worth over nearly 20 million).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, by the time the two "tied the knot" in an unofficial ceremony, Paul revealed Mongeau's ring had been upgraded to a $300,000 diamond-- much more befitting of his YouTube fortune!</p><h2 id=lamborghini-huracan-performante---350-000>Lamborghini Huracan Performante - $350,000</h2><p>The third and most expensive car on this list is Jake's Lamborghini Huracan Preformante. In a video entitled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"BUYING MY $350,000 DREAM CAR *emotional*"</a> Jake Paul takes viewers on his journey to obtaining this outrageously expensive dream whip.</p><p>Jake Paul's electric blue&nbsp;dream car&nbsp;is complete with a tri-color stripe along the doors and boasts an impressive 631 horsepower at 8000 rpm and 443 lb-ft of torque at 6500 rpm.</p><h2 id=calabasas-mansion---6-9-million>Calabasas Mansion - $6.9 Million</h2><p>After leaving his rental on bad terms his landlord, Paul took the Team 10 headquarters to a mansion in Calabasas. At only 20, Jake Paul bought <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> stunning and sprawling Calabasas Mansion for $6.9 dollars.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Homes Ever Sold In Los Angeles</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home is over 15,000 square feet and has 3.5 acres of land attached -- allowing ample room for Team 10 to conduct pranks and shenanigans without outraging their neighbors. It also has eight bedrooms, three stories, a spiral staircase, and a home movie theatre straight from the pages of a magazine!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Richest YouTubers Of 2019</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3orfEZqearZyoeqbEz56lrKGmmnqxwdGcn5qrlah8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./next-level-chef-kenny-everett-age-height-wiki-wife-instagram-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Next Level Chef: Kenny Everett Age Height Wiki; Wife Instagram And Net Worth">&larr;
