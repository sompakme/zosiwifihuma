First printed in 1748, this book has been banned on and off for over a quarter of a century in various countries around the world. In fact, it was illegal to publish it in the United States until 1966.</p><p></p><h2 id=24-things-fall-apart-by-chinua-achebe><strong>24) Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe</strong></h2><p>Via litflick.wordpress.com</p><p>First published in 1958, this book caused a stir for its subtext (both subtle and not) and criticism about colonialism – particularly British Colonialism and Christian influence in Africa. Malaysia still bans the book.</p><p></p><h2 id=23-slaughterhouse-five-by-kurt-vonnegut><strong>23) Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut</strong></h2><p>Via digilib.bu.edu</p><p>Captured during the Battle of the Bulge, Billy Pilgrim is brought to Slaughterhouse number five by his captors and must attempt to survive the end of the war. It has been removed from countless libraries over the years as well and it often makes the list of most challenged books in America because of its themes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=22-the-communist-manifesto-by-karl-marx-and-friedrich-egles><strong>22) The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Egles</strong></h2><p>Via radenko-milak.blogspot.com</p><p>A critical look at capitalism, the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, is partly responsible for the rise of communism throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The book claims that capitalism is only a theoretical success.</p><p></p><h2 id=21-adventures-of-huckleberry-finn-by-mark-twain><strong>21) Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain</strong></h2><p>Via pastispresent.org</p><p>Often required reading for adolescents, this book's continued use of the ‘n-word’ and an overabundance of vulgarity make it controversial. Others claim the oversimplification of blacks is problematic. At the time it was published the anti-slavery message was also a major mark against it.</p><p></p><h2 id=20-the-anarchist-cookbook-by-william-powell><strong>20) The Anarchist Cookbook by William Powell</strong></h2><p>Via amazon.com</p><p>It contains some terribly dangerous designs for creating bombs that probably won’t work and instructions on how to make some potentially illegal substances. Powell’s work was written during his youth and at the height of the Vietnam War, and its very anti-government nature and terroristic themes are controversial, to say the least.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=19-origins-of-the-species-by-charles-darwin><strong>19) Origins of the Species by Charles Darwin</strong></h2><p>Via thewrittenwordreviews.wordpress.com</p><p>Darwin’s greatest work has become something of an inadvertent attack on Christianity and a rallying cry for pro-evolutionists. <i>Origins of the Species </i>has been blamed by many for causing the chasm between Christians and science and it shall likely remain ever so.</p><p></p><h2 id=18-a-million-little-pieces-by-james-frey><strong>18) A Million Little Pieces by James Frey</strong></h2><p>Via hachette.com.au</p><p>Not so controversial because of the content,&nbsp;<i>A Million Little Pieces </i>is the memoir of James Frey. Also, most of it is a lie. Frey’s book was applauded at first, then subsequently ripped by <a title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth" href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> after details surfaced that Frey altered the truth.</p><p></p><h2 id=17-the-color-purple-by-alice-walker><strong>17) The Color Purple by Alice Walker</strong></h2><p>Via music123.com</p><p>It features sex, spousal rape, incestuous rape, spousal abuse and homosexuality.

Salinger</strong></h2><p>When it was published in 1951 it was considered vulgar and profane – even though by modern standards it’s not worse than some of the things you hear every day on television today. Teenage angst and the end of innocence are still important themes today and attitudes about the book have changed greatly in the last 50 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-the-harry-potter-series-by-j-k-rowling><strong>13) The Harry Potter Series by J.K.

Kafka was banned in his home country of Czechoslovakia because he wrote it in German. It was also banned by the Nazis and Soviets.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-by-stephen-chobsky><strong>9) The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chobsky</strong></h2><p>Via dlalrc.blogspot.com</p><p><i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</i> involves a teenager sending letters to an anonymous friend where he vividly describes his experiences with sex, abuse and drugs.

Rushdie’s opinions on the Islamic faith is widely considered to be heretical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-topic-of-cancer-by-henry-miller><strong>7) Topic of Cancer by Henry Miller</strong></h2><p>Via genre-x.com</p><p>Miller’s book is largely autobiographical and focuses on the lives of expats living abroad in France.
