Ever since she was young, she has heard about her late father Kurt Cobain's legendary place in the <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> industry. Whenever someone brings up Nirvana's hit song "Smells Like Teen Spirit" or Cobain's untimely death, she must feel a mixture of emotions.</p><p>Now that Frances Bean Cobain is in her early 30s, people are curious about what her adult life is like. It makes sense that over the past couple of years, there have been rumors about who she's dating. At one point, people wondered if she was in a relationship with Kurt Cobain's Nirvana bandmate Dave Grohl. There's more to this story, however...</p><h2 id=is-the-rumor-that-frances-bean-cobain-dated-dave-grohl-true>Is The Rumor That Frances Bean Cobain Dated Dave Grohl True?</h2><p><a href=#>Frances Bean Cobain and Courtney Love's bond</a> has been strained for a long time.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney Love tweeted about Cobain and Grohl</a>. She wrote, “I hear from frannies roommate that @davegrohl hit on frances."</p><p>Love also said, "It's natural she'd be curious to find out why I don't like this man, and why her father doesn't." She continued, "I'm sure Frances can take care of herself because she is of age, and I love her and want her to live her life," according to The NY Daily News.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frances-bean-cobain.jpg><p>Both Grohl and Cobain said that this wasn't true. There is no evidence that the two ever dated. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a representative for Grohl explained to Gawker, "These new accusations are upsetting, offensive and absolutely untrue.”</p><p>Frances Bean Cobain commented on this situation through a PR company that represented the Foo Fighters. She said, “While I’m generally silent on the affairs of my biological mother. Her recent tirade has taken a gross turn. I have never been approached by Dave Grohl in more than a platonic way. I’m in a monogamous relationship and very happy.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kurt Cobain’s Daughter Frances Bean Cobain’s Instagram Shares The Truth About Her Extremely Private Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It sounds like it was upsetting for both Cobain and Grohl to read these tweets from Love.</p><p>It would have definitely been strange if Cobain and Grohl had dated. There is an age difference between them, for one thing. Cobain is 30 years old and Grohl is 54. It also seems that Grohl must have some complex emotions about his late bandmate's daughter since Kurt Cobain's life ended in such a tragic way. Grohl was there during Kurt and Courtney Love's marriage and Nirvana was at the height of their success and popularity when Love gave birth to Frances Bean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jordyn-blum-dave-grohl.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cobain and Grohl have both had various relationships. While it's possible that Frances Bean Cobain had some romances that she never made public, people know about at least two of her partners. Cobain and Isaiah Silva were married from 2014 to 2017. Then, around 2022, <a href=#>Cobain and Tony Hawk's son Riley Hawk</a> began dating.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Frances Bean Cobain Got This Insane Amount Of Money When She Turned 30</a></span></p><p>Dave Grohl has been married to Jordyn Blum since 2003.

She wouldn't remember meeting Dave Grohl back then, of course.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/frances-bean-cobain-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, both Frances Bean Cobain and Dave Grohl have talked about getting to know each other when she was grown up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Frances Bean Cobain Have To Go Back To Work After Blowing Through $11 Million Of Kurt Cobain's Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>According to the Alternative Press, Grohl was interviewed on WAAF, a radio station in Boston, and he talked about seeing Frances Bean when she was much older.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Dave-Grohl-Will-Put-Anyone-On-The-Spot-For-Having-To-Sign-An-Autograph-(show-candid-photos-of-Grohl-at-airport).jpg><p>He said, “It was awhile ago, I hadn’t seen her since she was a little kid. I hadn’t seen her since she was 4 or 5 years old. Pat, Krist, and I went over to hang out with her Grandma, and Kurt’s sister, and she is right. People that knew Kurt, when you meet her for the first time, you’re like wow, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. I didn’t think it was creepy, but I sure did feel like she was very familiar. She seemed very familiar to me, for sure.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alternative Press reported that Frances Bean also mentioned this get-together in an interview with Rolling Stone. She said that Nirvana members Grohl, Krist Novoselic, and Pat Smear get "the K.C. Jeebies" looking at her. She explained, "when they see me, they see Kurt. They look at me, and you can see they’re looking at a ghost."</p><p>It's not clear how often Frances Bean and Grohl see each other or if they have a friendship at all. It's possible that they don't keep in touch. It might be too painful for both of them since Grohl has so many memories of being part of Nirvana.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/frances-bean-cobain.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Frances Bean and Grohl seem to agree on one thing: they want to maintain some privacy surrounding Kurt Cobain. Frances Bean has only said a few things about her father in interviews, and Grohl doesn't talk about Kurt all that often, either.</p><p>In 2021, Grohl was interviewed on Absolute Radio when he was promoting his memoir "The Storyteller." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grohl talked about Kurt Cobain</a> and shared a really nice story. He said that he was in the car once with his daughter Harper and she asked some questions about Kurt. This gave him the opportunity to chat a bit about his late friend and bandmate.</p><p>Grohl also said that it was tough to hear Nirvana for a while, but his children like the music. He said, “I don’t want to hear that. It would bring back lots of difficult memories but now I'll be driving with my kids in the car now and a Nirvana song will come on and they will start singing it and they know the words, and we don’t listen to it at home but somehow it's become a part of their lives now and its cool.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdm7%2BiusKeqmaalZa7bq%2FOm5iipl2ZrrWxjJ2Yr51dnL%2BwtMtmo5qslWKzosDHnqlmo6WnwW6vzpuYoqajYruqvtWapZpllKfCrrnEq2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-is-o-j-simpson-earning-money-since-his-millions-are-long-gone.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Is O.J.
