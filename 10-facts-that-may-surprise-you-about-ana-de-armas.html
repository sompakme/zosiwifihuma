Among the names to appear on this list of actresses taking Hollywood by storm are, in recent memory, Emma Stone, Jennifer Lawrence, Margot Robbie - and now, Ana de Armas. The sizzling Latina is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">picking up heat faster than most performers can even dream of</a>, but despite her obvious talent on camera, there's still much more to this soon-to-be heartthrob than just her acting abilities. Take a look at this list of 10 facts you might not know about Ana de Armas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Knives Out: Net Worth Of The Main Cast, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=born-in-santa-cruz-cuba-moved-to-madrid-spain>Born In Santa Cruz, Cuba/Moved To Madrid, Spain</h2><p>Unlike some actresses who decide to move across the country to pursue their dreams of making it in Hollywood, de Armas had to move across the globe as she was born in the Cuban city of Santa Cruz and was raised in the close by city of Havana. However, she didn't make Los Angeles the first pit-stop on her acting journey (despite having decided to become an actress at the age of 12) and traveled to Madrid, Spain where she landed her first film role at the age of 16.</p><h2 id=trained-at-the-national-school-of-theater-in-cuba>Trained At The National School Of Theater In Cuba</h2><p>As we just stated, the aspiring superstar was born and grew up in Cuba before making the big leap to America and Los Angeles to pursue her acting career, but she had already decided well before making the move what her career was going to be since she attended the National School of Theater in Cuba. Ana de Armas credits her time in school as some of the most important when it comes to her overall career, especially&nbsp;since she was still attending school when she had her first three experiences working on a film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=married-for-2-years>Married For 2 years</h2><p>Divorce is an unfortunate circumstance that occurs far too often in the world of celebrities.&nbsp;It can sometimes come about when one member of the couple starts to take off, in terms of their career and seemingly begins to overshadow their partner, resulting in an imminent split. For de Armas, however, her untimely marriage met it's conclusion well before her spark caught fire as she and her ex-husband, actor Marc Clotet, were married from 2011-2013 when de Armas hadn't even moved to the U.S. yet. Luckily, she's now dating Alejandro Pineiro Bello and the two seem quite happy together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-an-amazing-dancer>She's An Amazing Dancer</h2><p>She may have moved here to pursue an acting career, but even if her professional life hadn't taken off in the way that it has, she could realistically still have a career in the entertainment business as de Armas has displayed her talent for dancing on several occasions. The Cuban actress is very active on social media and will often share videos of herself and friends moving along to whatever beat happens to be on in the background. Along with the seemingly impromptu dance parties that pop up on her follower's news feeds, de Armas has also done video shoots for magazines such as GQ where she shows off her fiery feet.</p><h2 id=takes-her-puppy-everywhere>Takes Her Puppy Everywhere</h2><p>While becoming a famous actor seems like the most glamorous lifestyle imaginable to those living on the outside of it, being a celebrity certainly has its pitfalls - such as the paparazzi.&nbsp; The relentless photos being taken can often be annoying to the stars of Hollywood, while also revealing private details about the person's life. When it comes to Ana de Armas, those paparazzi photos revealed that she takes her dog with her -&nbsp;everywhere. As de Armas' stock has quickly risen in Hollywood, so have her amount of paparazzi photos and seemingly every single one of them includes the actress' dog, Elvis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Net Worth Of Each 007 Actor</a></span></p><h2 id=didn-t-speak-english-for-first-u-s-film-role>Didn't Speak English For First U.S. Film Role</h2><p>Things happened much quicker for de Armas' career than she expected them to because (while she did have a manager at the time) she didn't even have an audition for the first film she landed.&nbsp;She moved to Los Angeles in 2014 and was spotted in the CAA parking lot when she was deemed 'perfect' for the role and just had to meet with director Eli Roth. She ended up getting the part but had real trouble with her lines since she still barely spoke a word of English at the time of shooting.</p><h2 id=had-a-role-in-a-spanish-television-show-called-el-internado>Had A Role In A Spanish Television Show Called El Internado</h2><p>Even though de Armas landed her first international roles while living in the United States, she made it clear from the second she touched down in Madrid that she was serious about acting, and her casting in the show&nbsp;El Internado&nbsp;helped solidify that.&nbsp;She played the role of Carolina Leal Solis for 52 episodes on the drama-thriller about a fictional boarding school set in a forest far away from the city. The show ran from May 2007&nbsp;until October&nbsp; 2010 and truly gave de Armas her first taste of what a steady life as an actress was like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-a-movie-coming-up-with-ben-affleck-called-deep-water>Has A Movie Coming Up With Ben Affleck Called&nbsp;Deep Water</h2><p>As we said at the beginning of this article, de Armas is an actress whose spark caught faster than anybody could have anticipated, and it certainly shows with all of her upcoming projects as every one of them is an awards-caliber film, starting with&nbsp;Deep Water, a psychological thriller that will find de Armas starring opposite of Ben Affleck. The premise revolves around a book of the same name where the couple (de Armas and Affleck) end up becoming involved in a murder-mystery love story that is bound to excite and please audiences.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Reasons Why Hollywood Should Give Ben Affleck Another Chance</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-the-next-bond-girl>She's The Next&nbsp;Bond&nbsp;Girl</h2><p>As if starring opposite Ben Affleck wasn't enough of a career-booster, de Armas is going to keep adding to her quickly growing Hollywood resume with a huge kicker as she is going to be in the next&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James Bond</a>&nbsp;film, scheduled to come out in the middle of next year. It's rather unfortunate that we have to wait to see de Armas in this one because the film was pushed back several months due to complications during filming and would ordinarily already be out for audiences to enjoy her performance. Guess we'll just have to wait a little bit longer to see her 007 experience unfold.</p><h2 id=she-s-playing-marilyn-monroe-in-blonde>She's Playing Marilyn Monroe In&nbsp;Blonde</h2><p>One of the clear-cut signs that an actor or actress has started to make it in Hollywood is when they're cast as an already iconic historical figure. That's exactly the case for de Armas and her career as she continues to add high prolific projects to her filmography record,&nbsp;as she has been cast to play Marilyn Monroe in the upcoming film, Blonde. The movie doesn't have a release date and is currently in post-production, but several on-set photos of de Armas in costume have leaked to the public and she couldn't look more perfect for the role. Suffice to say that this Cuban starlet is going to be sticking around Hollywood for quite some time - and nobody is complaining.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest-Earning Actresses From 2010 to 2019</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8CnmGaclWKus7nArGStqpmrtqJ506Kbm6GkqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-piru-and-a-crip-talk-the-significance-of-kendrick-lamar-s-new-reebok-sneaker.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Piru And A Crip Talk The Significance of Kendrick Lamar's New Reebok Sneaker">&larr;
