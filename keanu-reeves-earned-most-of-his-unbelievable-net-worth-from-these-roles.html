Since then, Reeves has consistently proven himself as an established actor through his countless roles in what turned out to be some<a href=#> pretty iconic films</a>. Because of this, it’s easy to see how the actor was able to amass his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">impressive net worth of $380 million</a>.
