While his career proved to be full of longevity thanks to hit record and hit record, plus multiple streams of income in additional business ventures like producing, movies, and vodka distribution (just to name a few), a big reason why 50 Cent's name cannot stay out of our mouths is that he can't help but keep beefing with just about everyone in the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For crying out loud, his very first single - "How to Rob" - was all about him having beefs and wanting to rob everyone from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah Carey</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Smith</a>. Granted, that song was all in good fun and practically a parody, but it only highlights how 50 entered the industry criticizing famous people and nearly three decades later, he is not slowing down anytime soon. To his credit, he has managed to maintain quite a few friendships in this business, but there are enough beefs that we cannot talk about one without the other.</p><h2 id=rival-vivica-a-fox><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><strong>Rival: Vivica A. Fox</strong></span></h2><p>50 Cent actually used to date Vivica A. Fox several years ago, but considering how both parties have criticized each other since breaking up, it is safe to say that they did not end on good terms. Granted, years after the fact, Fox guest-starred on his 50 Central show, which suggests the heat has eased down in recent memory at least just a bit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Women 50 Cent Dated (And 10 Who'd Say No)</a></span></p><h2 id=rival-the-game><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><strong>Rival: The Game</strong></span></h2><p>Early on in both of their careers, The Game and 50 Cent were good friends. So much so that the latter wrote songs on the former's debut album. However, their friendship derailed to the point that they had a well-documented shootout against each other. 10 years later, their relationship is still fractured.</p><h2 id=friend-rotimi><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><strong>Friend:&nbsp;Rotimi</strong></span></h2><p>The two have showcased chemistry on the show Power - where they play frenemies/partners Dre and Kanan - and in music, as 50 featured on one of Rotimi's most popular songs, "Lotto." It looked like a beef was brewing last year where 50 accused him of owing him money, but Rotimi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clarified to Kristine Leahy on Fair Game</a> that it wasn't real beef; all in good fun between friends.</p><h2 id=rival-oprah><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Rival: Oprah</strong></span></h2><p>50 Cent has said some nasty things about Oprah over the years. In more recent months, he took to Instagram (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">h/t Chicago Tribune</a>) accusing her of only "going after black men" in the media without applying the same level of criticisms to people who are not men or women of color.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friend-pop-smoke><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Friend:&nbsp;Pop Smoke</strong></span></h2><p>This is the only friendly name on the list who is no longer with us, as the up and coming rapper was murdered in his home earlier this year during a home invasion. As a friend and supporter of his work, 50 Cent agreed to executive produce Pop Smoke's final and posthumous studio album that he was working on before he died.</p><h2 id=rival-gayle-king><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Rival: Gayle King</strong></span></h2><p>With Gayle King being Oprah Winfrey's best friend, it should come as no surprise that she did not take kindly to any of the negative comments which 50 has said about her pal. In his new book, Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter, 50 details how King once actually confronted him in person about his comments directed at Oprah.</p><h2 id=friend-chris-brown><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Friend: Chris Brown</strong></span></h2><p>50 Cent has made some playful comments at Chris Brown in the past, mostly making fun of the singer dying his hair, but it's all out of playfulness. 50 is practically an older brother figure to Brown, who he has frequently collaborated with on songs like "No Romeo, No Juliet" and "I'm The Man" in addition to hanging out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rival-lloyd-banks><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Rival: Lloyd&nbsp;Banks</strong></span></h2><p>Lloyd Banks was once a member of 50 Cent's gangster music troupe G-Unit, but when 50 fell out with the entire group, he also fell out with Banks. 50 has admitted in the past that he is no longer on speaking terms and he even went as far as to diss him and past G-Unit members last summer. So much for any hopes of a reunion tour.</p><h2 id=friend-lil-wayne><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Friend: Lil Wayne</strong></span></h2><p>While a lot of rivals on this list used to be friends of 50 Cent, this is a rare case of a rival becoming a friend. The two had minor beef years back following<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> an interview with Funkmaster Flex </a>where 50 called Lil Wayne a "whore" who would do business with "anyone," but years after, they were able to make peace and become friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Little Known Facts About Lil Wayne's Rise To Fame</a></span></p><h2 id=rival-kanye-west><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Rival: Kanye West</strong></span></h2><p>At the height of 50's fame, Kanye was on the rise. West's new fame was solidified was when his Graduation album sold more sales than 50's&nbsp;Curtis album when 50 was the top selling rapper at the time. 50 might still be salty about losing that battle, since he roasts Kanye on social media whenever he gets the chance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friend-omari-hardwick><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Friend: Omari Hardwick</strong></span></h2><p>One of 50 Cent's biggest successes outside of rap music has been in producing the Starz series Power and its coinciding television franchise spinoffs. As a result, he has developed a close relationship with the show's leading star Omari Hardwick. Not just any business associate will be allowed to kiss 50 on the forehead, after all.</p><h2 id=rival-naturi-naughton><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Rival: Naturi Naughton</strong></span></h2><p>In sharp contrast, 50 Cent is not so close with his show's co-star, Naturi Naughton. The lead actress on Power took the opportunity to call 50 Cent an on-set bully after he posted an Instagram meme where he compared her looks to a Mortal Kombat character. Rather than apologize, 50 just kept posting mean memes.</p><h2 id=friend-dr-dre><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Friend: Dr. Dre</strong></span></h2><p>Dr. Dre helped 5o Cent breakout in this industry after the young New York rapper first signed on to Dre's label, where he became a megastar thanks to hits like "In Da Club." Clearly, to this day, 50 remains grateful and Dre remains appreciative. He even showed up to the unveiling of 50's Walk of Fame star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Milestones Of Dr. Dre's Career From 1984-2019, In Pictures</a></span></p><h2 id=rival-rick-ross><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Rival: Rick Ross</strong></span></h2><p>This might be the ugliest feud on this list. What started as a beef regarding their music - including diss tracks like "Officer Ricky" - quickly became personal when 50 released an unsolicited adult tape starring the mother of Ross' child with another man as revenge. Because he released it without her permission, she sued 50 and won a lawsuit, bankrupting 50.</p><h2 id=friend-6ix9ine><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Friend: 6ix9ine</strong></span></h2><p>To call these two friends may be debatable at this point. Considering that 50 Cent has noticeably taken a step back from supporting the young rapper following his recent prison sentence where he was exposed for snitching, 50 mentored <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6ix9ine</a> as one of his biggest supporters beforehand, even likening him to being the new King of New York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rival-floyd-mayweather><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Rival: Floyd Mayweather</strong></span></h2><p>As was the case with several other rivals on this list, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Mayweather</a> and 50 Cent were the best of friends before they eventually had a falling out.&nbsp;For what now feels like a never-ending beef, the rapper and the boxer have continued to trade verbal jabs - often with one accusing the other of being broke - with no end in sight.</p><h2 id=friend-eminem><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Friend: Eminem</strong></span></h2><p>50 Cent and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem </a>are frequent collaborators, good friends, and even former label mates. To this day, they are still close as Em - who is notorious for not socializing in public often - came out of the house for his friend's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony recently, much like the aforementioned Dr. Dre.</p><h2 id=rival-ja-rule><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Rival: Ja Rule</strong></span></h2><p>The feud between 50 Cent and Ja Rule has been well documented and after over two decades of beef, it looks like their relationship isn't getting anywhere close to mending fences. Then again, 50 Cent has dissed Ja so often in songs, interviews and even social media that it's clear he does not want to bury the hatchet any time soon.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Where Ja Rule Has Been Hiding Ever Since Fyre Festival</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhsaWWTmru1ecGeqq1llqe2prrDrGSappRir6qzxp6qrWWWmsKlv4yrmKmolad6s63PZqCnnKWowbPFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./akio-toyoda-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Akio Toyoda Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
