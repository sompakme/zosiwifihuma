According to Variety, each of the leading cast members will be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid a whopping $200,000 per episode</a> of the show. That means that they will all be seeing their net worth rise but about $2 million minus taxes, representation and legal fees, of course. But the leading cast of The Umbrella Academy aren't the only ones who have made some decent dough from the series. After all, there have been a number of actors who have seen their characters killed off after having significant arcs. While they likely won't be appearing in the third season, their bank accounts must be happy for their short roles on the enormously successful show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then there are the newbies. Yes, Umbrella Academy Season Three has a load of new actors set to make a lot of money on the show. These actors are The Sparrows, the alternative universe version of The Umbrella Academy. But who are these actors and just how much money are they worth in comparison to the Hargreeeves children? Here are the net worths of every major Season Three character, new and old...</p><h2 id=britne-oldford-is-worth-1-million><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Britne Oldford Is Worth $1 Million</span></h2><p>According to Idol Net Worth, the Blindspot, and Arrowverse star is worth somewhere around $1 million. She's best-known for playing Peek-a-Boo in The Flash as well as her role on American Horror Story and in the outlandishly successful British teen drama Skins. She will be playing the misanthropic Fei (AKA Number 3) of The Sparrow Academy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-cornwell-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Justin Cornwell Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><p>Justin Cornwell will be playing Marcus (AKA Number One), the leader of the Sparrows. According to the comics that the series are based, Marcus has the power of super-strength. It makes sense that his net worth isn't exactly set as he has only been in a few things. However, this includes The Training Day series and a couple of success TV movies.</p><h2 id=javon-walton-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Javon Walton Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has just been announced that Euphoria's Javon Walton (Ashtray) will be joining the cast of Umbrella Academy Season Three. Who he will be playing exactly is under wraps. Thanks to Euphoria and Utopia, as well as a his amateur boxing career (despite only being 15), Javon is worth between $1 - 5 Million. Although Idol Net Worth says he's as rich as $12 million... but that's unlikely.</p><h2 id=justin-h-min-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Justin H. Min Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><p>Thanks to roles in After Yang, New Amsterdam, Pure Genius, and Dating After College, the actor behind Ben Hargreeves has made a decent living. But there's no doubt Umbrella Academy accounts for most of his net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-caste-ntilde-eda-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>David Casteñeda Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><p>There's a lot of misinformaiton out there about David Casteñeda's net worth. Many soruces claim the Diego actor is only worth $500,000. Then there's Legit.NG's belief that he's worth $800,000. Neither of therse numbers account of his two years on Umbrella Academy as a lead, his raise for the third season, or his work in numerous other shows and movies. So, BuzzLearn's estimated of between $1 - 5 Million makes the most sense.</p><h2 id=ritu-arya-is-worth-2-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ritu Arya Is Worth $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to starring in Red Notice, Ritu's net worth skyrocketed to $2 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Aside from playing Lila in Umbrella Academy and her role in Red Notice, Ritu has also been in Humans, Doctors, and Feel Good.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Ritu Arya's Net Worth After Starring In 'Red Notice'</a></span></p><h2 id=aidan-gallagher-is-worth-2-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Aidan Gallagher Is Worth $2 Million</span></h2><p>Aidan Gallagher is arguably the most recognizable breakout star from Umbrella Academy. But prior to joining the cast, he really didn't have a lot of credit to his name. This is, of course, except the Nickelodeon series Nicky, Ricky, Dicky, and Dawn.</p><h2 id=emmy-raver-lampman-is-worth-2-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Emmy Raver-Lampman Is Worth $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like a few of her castmates, Emmy is worth around $2 million according to numerous sources. Aside from her leading role of Allison Hargreeves, Emmy hasn't done a lot of notable work. However, she has been a voice actor on Apple TV+'s Central Park as well as been in Liam Neeson's BlackLight.</p><h2 id=genesis-rodriguez-is-worth-2-5-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Genesis Rodriguez Is Worth $2.5 Million</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Genesis Rodriguez is worth $2.5 million. The Miami-born actor has done hundreds of episodes of soap operas as well as Telemundo shows over the first half of her career. Then there's her impressive resume of voice-over work, including playing Honey Lemon in Big Hero 6. She will be playing Sloane, The Sparrow Academy's version of Number 5.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-sheehan-is-worth-2-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Robert Sheehan Is Worth $2.5 Million</span></h2><p>According to Looper, the man behind Klaus Hargreeves is worth $2.5 million. While his role on The Umbrella Academy accounts for most of it, Robert has also made money from Mortal Engines, Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones, Fortitude, and Misfits.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are Robert Sheehan's Biggest Roles (Besides 'Umbrella Academy')</a></span></p><h2 id=jake-epstein-is-worth-3-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jake Epstein Is Worth $3 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to playing Craig Manning on the long-running and successful teen soap, Degrassi: The Next Generation for seven years, Jake is worth a notable $3 million. He's also had notable roles in Suits and Designated Survivor. He will be playing The Sparrow Academy's Number 4, Alphonso.</p><h2 id=colm-feore-is-worth-3-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Colm Feore Is Worth $3 Million</span></h2><p>Reginald Hargreevez is easily the most mysterious character in the series. But his real life net worth isn't as mysterious as the one depicted in the series.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> According Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Colm Feore is worth $3 million. The Canadian actor has a lenghty history in theater but has made money from roles in Chicago, Thor, Revolution, The Borgias, and House of Cards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hopper-is-worth-between-5---6-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tom Hopper Is Worth Between $5 - 6 Million</span></h2><p>Celebrity Net Worth says the Luther actor is worth $5 million, but other more recently updated sources claim he's made $6. Given the success of his role in The Umbrella Academy, as well as Black Sails and Game of Thrones, it's no surprise that his net worth has grown before Season Three premieres.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Luther From ‘Umbrella Academy, Tom Hopper, Dating In Real Life?</a></span></p><h2 id=cazzie-david-is-worth-10-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Cazzie David Is Worth $10 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Cazzie David lived at home until recently, one could argue that her net worth is actually by far the largest on this list. That's because she's Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm creator Larry David's daughter. He's worth an incredible $400 million. It's only natural to believe that <a href=#>some of his net worth went to her</a>. But Cazzie has been making money on her own with a few web series, acting roles, and her book, "No One Asked For This". There's no doubt that her role as the quiet Number 6 of The Sparrow Academy will increase her personal net worth exponentially. But for now, Cazzie is worth $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><h2 id=elliot-page-is-worth-12-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Elliot Page Is Worth $12 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's really no surprise that <a href=#>Elliot Page has amazed such an incredible fortune</a>. He did star in the X-Men movies, after all. Not only that but as Ellen, Elliot was one of the most prolific actors of his generation. He has made time for big blockbusters, indie thrillers, and of course acclaimed dramas such as Juno.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Fans Can Expect From 'Umbrella Academy' Season 3</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGisppqimrmtrYyampqclaLGbr%2FEmqqopl1oeqSt0q1kq5meoLKlec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-chef-s-delight-top-9-restaurants-owned-by-celebrity-chefs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Chef's Delight: Top 9 Restaurants Owned By Celebrity Chefs">&larr;
