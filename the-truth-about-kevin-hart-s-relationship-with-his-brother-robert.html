However, only the fans who tuned into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor’s Netflix documentary</a> know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin’s past is actually pretty complicated</a>. In&nbsp;Don’t F*** This Up,&nbsp;the comedian opens up about his life’s biggest challenges— ranging from his unprivileged childhood to later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">marital issues with wife Eniko Parrish</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The most compelling part of the film, however, focuses on Kevin’s relationship with his brother Robert Hart. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a report by</a>&nbsp;Distractify,&nbsp;Robert got into a lot of trouble in his youth. Even Keven has admitted that, “Any mistakes you could make as a teenager, he made.” Now, fans are wondering where that leaves Kevin’s brother. Has Robert managed to improve his life? And how close are the two brothers today? Here’s the truth about Kevin and Robert’s relationship:</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Hart Reveals BTS View Of New Movie ‘The Man From Toronto’</a></span></p><h2 id=the-younger-years>The Younger Years</h2><p>The documentary reveals that Kevin and Robert were raised by their mother Nancy Hart, since their father Henry Witherspoon was not in a position to care for two boys. Witherspoon, according to the film, spent most of his sons’ childhood battling a cocaine addiction that landed him in jail on more than one occasion. Despite the lack of a solid father figure, both Kevin and Robert were able to rely on Nancy to provide them the parental love that they needed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike modern, ‘helicopter parents,’ Nancy wanted to give her sons a sense of liberty to express themselves and make their own decisions.&nbsp;For Robert, though, the trust and respect of his mother was not enough to keep him off the streets.</p><p>Robert spent his adolescence involved with the wrong people. As Kevin told fans in his Netflix series, “My brother was in a gang. He dealt drugs.” But that wasn’t all. Kevin went on to explain that Robert preyed on someone weaker than he was—an action that ultimately resulted in his expulsion from his own family. “One afternoon,” the actor said, “my brother actually tried to snatch a purse from an old lady. That there was the last straw for my mom. She took my brother to court and got him emancipated.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Hart Joins Nick Jonas & Michelle Obama In Voting Challenge</a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=learning-how-to-reconnect>Learning How To Reconnect</h2><p>In spite of the rough outcome of Robert’s adolescence, that part of his life is in the past. The former troubled teen grew up into a more responsible adult who chooses to prioritize family over everything.&nbsp;For one thing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert’s Instagram account</a> is peppered with photos of the younger generation of Hart’s, including his own&nbsp;kids as well as his niece. But what about his brother?</p><p>The good news is that Robert and Kevin were able to repair their relationship. The two were spotted together on multiple occasions. Kevin even invited his brother to spend one special Christmas together in Aspen. How chic!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robert also was able to understand Nancy’s choice to emancipate him in court. Ultimately, her decision to kick Robert out of the house did not change his love for his momma. The proud son has even shared a photo of Nancy’s grace to his social media with the caption, “my mom was the truth.” Those are powerful words that certainly reflect an improved relationship between the one estranged mother/son pair.</p><p>In the end, it seems that Robert is committed to forging a strong connection with those he loves. Almost all of his posts include the hashtag #FamilyTimeIsTheBestTime. In other words, it definitely seems that Robert has learned from his past experiences and is committed to do everything in his power to be an active member of his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Hart’s Som Can Throw A Serious Punch</a></span></p><h2 id=propping-his-brother-up>Propping His Brother Up</h2><p>Beyond spending quality time with Kevin and passing by Nancy’s grave, Robert seems excited to support his brother’s career. Based on his numerous Instagram posts about Kevin’s endeavors, Robert is extremely proud of his sibling.</p><p>When Kevin started in the film&nbsp;Night School,&nbsp;Robert showed his support by dedicating a few words of love to his successful actor brother. “So proud to witness this entire process & your growth kid,” Robert told Kevin, “Love ya kid & want the world to know it.” He even added a hashtag to emphasize how much he supports Kevin’s career: “Proudest Brother Ever.” So adorable!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robert has shown similar levels of support for Kevin’s comedy career. He even went so far as to share a ticket stub from one of his brother’s shows to his social media. Once again, he expressed his feelings through a hashtag, but this time he wrote, “proud big brother.” Aww!</p><p>Things haven’t always been easy for the Hart family, but the members of their adorable crew have managed to patch together broken ties.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Hart Gives An Insider’s View Of His At Home Comedic Process</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinq6Zo3qprdGtZJuqn6m1pr6Mq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZp6RmMG0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./torii-hunter-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Torii Hunter Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography">&larr;
