Numerous family members have served as King or Queen, with only those of royal blood allowed to be in that role. In some instances across history, there have been nations taken over or paired through marriage that changes this. In that, a kingdom might be taken or looped in with another monarchy. Therefore, the rulers change how things go down. Despite this, England has managed to keep it in the family for a very long time.</p><p>The interesting situation when it comes to the monarchy is that they're known for so many amazing things. They have helped their people and even allowed some the special honor of serving major roles for the nation. Truly, there are many instances throughout history where The Royal Family was seen as amazing, fair, and terrific for the people. Yet there are other moments in history that are much different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For every good thing kingdoms like this have done, there are multitudes of horrific things they have done too. At times, things might start out controversial and get progressively worse. Meanwhile, other things would show a bad mark on history from the very beginning. No matter which it ended up being, these dark points in history took the monarchy back. There are even multiple things known about them that they have tried to bury deep for years.</p><p>The lucky thing for those reading today is that we aren't the kind of people to let these things go unknown. While you may see The Royal Family of today in a good light, that is only due to amazing pay-offs and years of buried truths. Some things well-known before have seemingly been forgotten as well. Allow us to remind you, enlighten you, and at times surprise you. Please enjoy our list of dark secrets Queen Elizabeth wants you to forget about the monarchy.</p><h2 id=prince-philip-and-queen-elizabeth-ii-wedding-day-mess><strong>Prince Philip&nbsp;and Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;wedding day mess</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>96-year-old Prince Philip has been noted as a loyal servant to the crown. Historians claim that was he put with Queen Elizabeth II for protection, comfort, and obviously to help with future heirs. Due to her taking the throne so young, she was not completely prepared or ready for the job. That is where her husband was the most use. Philip is a well-educated man who served in the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, and British Army for years. Most of all, he had noble blood within him. Philip would be there for the Queen, becoming her best friend and best ally in all things. The connection the two had has been noted by historians and various biographies. However, things have not always been terrific with the royal couple.</p><p>There are multiple acts&nbsp;in which the Duke of Edinburgh had relations with other women. One of the most prominent known about has to do with the day of his wedding. He would marry Elizabeth seemingly without issue. However, a documentary on Channel 5 in The UK would speak about him&nbsp;having a relation with another woman that very day. The story goes that Philip was sent away on a tour overseas, which was thought to be useful in keeping him out of trouble. That did not seem to work out, as it appears he had a female friend with him on this tour. Then with him again on his way back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's even been linked to the Queen's cousin, Princess Alexandria of Kent. There are multiple other accounts on top of this. However, the Queen and Prince would manage to work things out. The couple has four children together, one girl and three boys. All of which are very grown and have children and even grandchildren of their own. Charles being the first-born will inherit the throne upon his mother's passing.</p><h2 id=prince-harry-the-stubborn><strong>prince harry the stubborn</strong></h2><p>While Prince Harry is all the rage today in England due to his upcoming marriage to the beautiful actress Megan Markle, he wasn't always in the positive spotlight. For years he's been in the news for something crazy. Regardless of what it was, he was followed a lot by those wishing to catch him in a crazy act. All of this truly started as a child, when he went through the "wild child" phase. During this time, he was quite into partying and "the hash" if you will.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, Harry was so into the stuff that the nickname for him at his school was "Hash Harry." These addictions and issues caused a number of problems. His father Prince Charles got tired of all of this and would send his son to the Featherstone Lodge. This was a recovery center for people with addictions. Basically, Charles sent his son Harry to rehab. While this made sense up to a point, the public knowledge of the move was likely not useful to the family.</p><p>Harry would never officially check in, but he spent the entire day at the Lodge. He would listen to stories of people who had addictions and recovered from them. It is said that Harry thought the experience was "eye-opening." It did take him a number of years to settle things down, but it seems he never went further than what he already did. The hope is that Markle will be able to settle him down completely. Regardless of this, it is likely the Queen wants people to forget about her grandson's past, especially since it did not show the family in a good light.</p><h2 id=sympathizers-were-rampant-in-the-royal-family><strong>Sympathizers Were Rampant In The Royal Family</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is an interesting fact that is usually lost in history when speaking about the Nazis and World War II. Before Adolph Hitler began to do the horrible things he did to the Jewish people, he actually offered up several Jews to nations like the United States and England, all of which turned down this random surge of people to their nation. Those who remained in Germany when Hitler took power were forced to watch or go through horrific actions. Before being elected to office by the people of Germany, there was a real issue involving the Jewish.</p><p>In this period, Jewish people owned a lot of things. Any narrative they wanted to put out there was present, liked or hated. From movies to stores, television, various business, you name it. Many were upset with their power, and ultimately&nbsp;this got Hitler into power. Weirdly enough, some from the English Royal Family also sympathized with Hitler and the idea of trying to change Germany. Many who were connected before he was elected to office would support him in his run. However, many backed away afterward for obvious reasons. Not only did England get involved in the WWII, they would fight against Germany.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was Prince George, Duke of Kent said to have been a sympathizer, but his brother Edward VIII was as well. Even his wife, who happened to be American, was a fan of Hitler beforehand. They even met up with Hitler during World War II (see above), seemingly happy with him and what he was doing. What is worse is that many years later Prince Harry had been seen wearing Nazi garb, seemingly as a joke for a costume party of sports. While some say Harry obviously isn't a Nazi sympathizer, the costume did not help matters. (Source: SBS)</p><h2 id=prince-charles-might-very-well-be-half-vampire><strong>Prince Charles Might Very Well Be Half-Vampire</strong></h2><p>While the heading is used in a joking manner, what we're about to reveal is by no means a joke. Prince Charles is the oldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, the current Queen of England. Yet he has a family history that, well, seems to be a bit odd. As many know by now, The Royal Family has had many accusations of affairs, noble or not. Most connections seem to connect to other Europeans. But this is not the rule, and in the case of Prince Charles, it's a bit different than most. Charles is related to Vlad III. Known to the world as Vlad The Impaler, the 15th-century Wallachian nobleman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He is mostly known for his lust for torture on opponents, drinking of enemy's blood, impaling his opponents and putting them in front of his castle, and much more. You know, a real ladies man. He became the inspiration for Dracula as a result of his actions. The relation is that&nbsp;Charles is Vlad's great-grandson, 16-times removed. The story goes that Vlad is connected to Princess Mary of Teck. In that, her family's lineage goes back to Vlad's. Therefore, she would be something like a great(multiplied by whatever)-granddaughter. She would then marry English King George V.</p><p>This would lead to George V and Mary of Teck having children, one being Queen Elizabeth II's father. Thereby making her the granddaughter of Mary. Liz is the mother of Charles, making him connected. The major connection is much larger. King George III suffered from porphyria, an iron-deficiency disease that makes the skin sensitive to the sun. This inspired the vampire myth and seemed to come out of Vlad's family too. For his part, Charles accepts the connection and has joked about it fondly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-hidden-prince-of-england><strong>The Hidden Prince Of England</strong></h2><p>While most all royal members of the family are known to the public, one thing is very very well-known. If the family does not want you to be seen, you won't be seen. If the family wants you gone, you'll be gone. This is not a debate of terms, it is a mere fact. History backs it up massively. When it comes to someone that the family does not want to be ousted from the family, but also does not want publicly known....things get tricky. This is where "the hidden Prince" comes into play. Known as John, he was the sixth son of King George V and Queen May.</p><p>The family was embarrassed by him, but also seemed to love him too much to see him thrown to the streets. This tricky issue caused rumors to get out for years that there was another child, but it could not really be proven for some time. The reason for the embarrassment regarding John was due to his epileptic seizures. He had many over the years, which was not useful to the family. These issues would show "weakness" in the family, something the Royals could not show the country or the world. The Prince lived his life out of the York Cottage at the Sandringham estate, hidden away from the nation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He would not live a long life, as these seizures would only grow to become more intense as he aged. This led to him eventually having a very massive seizure at the age of only 13, which resulted in his early passing. The family would eventually be public about John after passing, where they would discuss his illness. While most reports say he was hidden, there is some evidence claiming the monarchy did treat him favorably. In that, they would do what they could to take care of him, give him anything he wanted, etc. This is likely due to the seizures and mental illnesses that went along with it. Much of which is now believed to have been linked to autism.</p><h2 id=queen-elizabeth-ii-and-her-offshore-accounts-to-save-from-english-taxes><strong>Queen Elizabeth II And&nbsp;Her Offshore Accounts To Save From English Taxes</strong></h2><p>While this may be shocking to some, the monarchy has to pay taxes these days too. While much of it goes back to them, the taxes work like they do in other nations. They are used for building useful roads and keeping streets safe. They're used for the police, politician pay, and much more. Nothing really crazy regarding this. The Queen herself even has to pay taxes and seems to happily do it to support her country. The problem here is that this is a big lie. Queen Elizabeth II does not really pay as much as she is supposed to in taxes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Newsweek was able to find that the Queen had “invested at least $13.1 million into offshore tax-sheltered funds located in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda." This led to an investigation into the Queen's private funds, known as "The Duchy of Lancaster." They would find in this investigation that the Queen was able to put the money into these offshore accounts to avoid some significant taxes on her duchy. While putting money into things is nothing new, seeing the Queen do this to avoid taxes would be.</p><p>The duchy sits at around $680 million. These offshore investing allowed her to save $15 million from the English taxes, which is quite a savings. Due to the fact that she is the Queen and all, what can be done about her doing this? Absolutely nothing, at least constitutionally. While a normal commoner would likely see some sort of punishment for such a situation....Queen Liz has nothing to fear in the end.</p><h2 id=prince-andrew-s-allegations><strong>Prince Andrew's allegations</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all the major allegations of assault hitting the news, it is no shock that others would come about. While today we see most come out of Hollywood regarding actors, producers and more...we've also seen some connect to politicians. Even the President of the United States. However, it's not just the U.S. that has seen some horrible issues go down regarding this. We've also seen allegations come from the English monarchy. In particular, Prince Andrew. In 2014, a woman alleged that the Prince forced her to have "relations" a number of times in three separate geographical locations.</p><p>The woman's name is Virginia Roberts. When she made these claims, she was merely 17-years-old. This means if her claims were true, not only did the Prince force a woman to do the deed with him, but he forced a girl who was underage to do it. Roberts alleges that the Prince and his friend Jeffery Epstein, a known billionaire, were keeping her trapped. Clearly, this was a horrific thing that would have clearly been something Buckingham Palace would want to investigate and...oh wait, no. The Palace denied the Prince was involved in such a thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A judge then ruled later on that the allegations were to be stripped from court records. For those unaware, this will be a pattern. The Royal Family is above the law, it's one of the biggest perks of the job. While the Queen can put any royal in prison...she is likely the only one with such power. Considering the monarchy would likely never do this, and considering Andrew is the Queen's son....that wasn't going to happen. Even if found guilty of the crime. The theme of being above the law will be present throughout this list, so stay tuned.</p><h2 id=prince-william-gets-caught-in-an-awkward-situation><strong>Prince William Gets Caught In An Awkward Situation</strong></h2><p>It's said that you can pick your friends and you can pick those you hire to work with you, but you cannot pick your family members. It is a birth situation, and due to this, many problematic issues have come from members of The Royal Family. Over the years you would be surprised how many altercations these people are in. However, when it comes to the current monarchy...Harry is considered the bad boy of the crown. Meanwhile, brother William seems to have things handled relatively well. At least, he usually does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, William was supposed to be on a boys ski trip when he was photographed dancing. He also was not alone on the dance floor. <a href=#>A video </a>surfaced of him dancing with an Australian model named Sophia Taylor. This happened at a nightclub, and sadly William did not assume people would recognize him. Apparently, these royals ignore their celebrity way too often. Due to the ignorance, and the video coming out, William did not hit headlines in a positive way as usual. People close to The Royal Family claimed that Kate Middleton, the Prince's wife, would be unhappy with this. No shock, she was reportedly furious.</p><p>However, while the incident happened around March of 2017....it does look like William and Kate are fine a year later. William can be seen in the video clearly being intoxicated, and the dancing was far less than impactful as it's made out. Yet the visual of it certainly did not go over well with the family. It's safe to say Kate won't be letting William go on too many trips without her from now on. The Royal Family has tried to bury this story as best as possible. This is likely why we have seen so much from Will and Kate on the good-side in 2017. With now a new Royal Wedding hitting headlines also helping matters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-entire-kate-middleton-drama><strong>The Entire Kate Middleton Drama</strong></h2><p>Kate Middleton is now a Dutchess and married to Prince William, the future King of England. The two have children who would be heirs to the throne for years to come. The world seems to be happy now, but that was not always the case. Kate might be from what many would consider the upper-middle class....this was not "noble" or "royal" enough. Why is this such an issue? While Kate is well-educated and considered to be quite polite, nice, and genuine....she did not have the royal mannerisms needed. Queen Elizabeth II herself has actually worked with Kate on this over the years. By the time she married William, she fit in relatively well.</p><p>The problem is that her family has not. Her sister Pipa has been the center of news for many years and is known for being, shall we say "free" with her actions. Especially "free" with her clothing. Due to this, she has been in many local papers and some international headlines. Obviously, it's an embarrassment to Kate and the crown and the Monarchy has tried to bury these things when they get out...yet in the digital world that is not exactly easy. Another issue was that Kate has not considered her celebrity well enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to the celebrity of the Prince and his wife, paparazzi will follow them around. Regardless of where they go, they'll be there. Due to this, photos of Kate topless and less have been caught in photo-form. This has also made international headlines, causing massive embarrassment once more. Overall, Kate has been a lot to handle for the monarchy and if not for William's affection of her...the Queen would likely have made sure she was gone long ago. Today, Kate seems to have things handled and works to not be caught up in drama as often as she can. Sadly, this is not as easy in today's world.</p><h2 id=the-current-monarchy-amounts-to-basically-a-royal-mascot><strong>The Current Monarchy Amounts To Basically A Royal Mascot</strong></h2><p>While most see a Queen as someone who rules from her royal throne and decides everything the nation sees happen, that is not the case in England in the year 2018. In fact, Queen Elizabeth is basically nothing more than a mascot for the United Kingdom. Let us explain. Imagine you're thinking back about all the major monarchs in history. Think of major Kings and Queens well-known from your history books. Remember the stuff they did or could have done? Yeah, Queen Elizabeth can practically do none of this. Why is that? Originally, powers started to loosen with the signing of the Magna Carta. However, the ultimate changes would come later. When James VI inherited England's throne, Scotland and England would become one as a kingdom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, wars in the mid-1600s led to a break by the Republican Commonwealth of England started to dissolve power from the monarchy a bit more than the Magna Carta. Dating back to the time when Americans declared their independence from England...issues arose in the kingdom. After Americans would win the Revolutionary War, powers started to dissolve slowly but surely for the monarchy more than before. This was done mainly due to the fact that people lost trust&nbsp;and elected officials were a better option for government needs. This made the appointment of Prime Minister a bigger deal, as the PM was like a President of sorts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, during the World War II period, Winston Churchill was likely more of a figurehead in helping England through the war than the monarchy. The Queen of today does reserve some power. She could, in theory, do the following: declare war, remove ministers from power, sign bills into law, pardon anyone for any crime, and suspend or call back parliament. However, the monarchy usually only signs the laws in and no monarch has vetoed a bill for centuries. The rest is decided on people doing it for the monarch. These are the elected officials.&nbsp;In theory, the King or Queen could take more power on, but constitutional issues get in the way of he or she from being the monarch of old. The Royals are still above the law, however. So that is something, right?</p><h2 id=prince-william-was-almost-never-born><strong>Prince William Was Almost Never Born&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>While today Princess Diana is revered for the elegance and beauty she had as well as the sweet and kind nature of which she treated people...her life was not always glamorous. When she learned of being pregnant with her first son, William, she was seemingly happy. A male heir is considered the royal lottery after all, despite no need for male heirs to take the throne in this day and age. A first child is usually important to any mother, but Diana was going through a lot during this time and she did not consider things. Her marriage to&nbsp;Prince Charles was becoming problematic and she found herself incredibly depressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She would admit something horrifying when speaking to journalist Andrew Morton on a taped video called "The People's Princess." In this video, she spoke about her issues with the marriage and almost killing her first-born while she was 4 months pregnant due to throwing herself down the stairs. She told Morton:&nbsp;“I had told Charles I felt so desperate and I was crying my eyes out. He said I was crying wolf. ‘I’m not going to listen,’ he said. ‘You’re always doing this to me. I’m going riding now.’ So I threw myself down the stairs. The Queen comes out, absolutely horrified, shaking — she was so frightened.”</p><h2 id=the-princess-diana-s-relationships-puts-harry-s-father-into-question><strong>The Princess Diana's&nbsp;relationships Puts Harry's Father Into Question</strong></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Princess Diana was incredibly unhappy in her marriage to Prince Charles. This is not uncommon in royal marriages over the centuries, as many are forced. This is especially troubling on Princesses who are used by the King or Queen to unite nations. These arranged marriages are normally never healthy, and while some tend to work out very well, most are pretty much just a title without a real marriage. Charles is obviously the son of Queen Elizabeth II, making him the clear heir to her throne when she passes. Meanwhile his wife Diana would have been the Queen if she lived today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The real issue is that due to the marriage bringing two British nobles together, it made sense to think that it was a forced one. The families obviously wanted it to happen and Diana would become an instant Princess and future Queen, having children for the monarchy. The marriage, however, had pitfalls. This led Princess Diana to have a relationship with someone else, on which lasted for 5 years. Diana admitted this in an interview, claiming she had this&nbsp;relationship with Major James Hewitt.</p><p>Many speculate that due to the&nbsp;relationship happening around the time Diana's second pregnancy, Hewitt could be Harry's biological father. That would mean Prince Charles is not his father and he does not have any connection to the throne. He does have red hair, unlike Diana and Charles. Meanwhile, Hewitt notably did have red hair. It would not matter to most. William is&nbsp;obviously Charles' son and is also the first-born with the clear right to the throne. He has also had children who would take the spot after him. That said, Harry would be too far back in line to really make this matter as much as it possibly could have years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=queen-elizabeth-i-let-the-power-go-to-her-head><strong>Queen Elizabeth I&nbsp;let the power go to her head</strong></h2><p>Today Queen Elizabeth II is the one strong female leader that England has had, which, in some ways, has been terrific for the nation. While she has been great and a strong leader when called upon to be such, another Elizabeth was also known as a terrific leader as well. Interestingly, Liz the II is called this due to the Queen, who sat on the throne from 1533-1603. While this Queen was seen as a good ruler, she was also known to do some things that were clearly considered horrible. One such thing had to do with her close companion, Robert Dudley.</p><p>Known as the "Virgin Queen" who never wed, Elizabeth I did have one person by her side most days, Dudley. It believed by historians that Elizabeth and Dudley had a relationship, but one thing got in the way. Robert happened to be married. His wife's name was Amy Robsart, and considered to be a good woman by those who knew her. This put a big problem in front of the lovers. The only hope was that the healthy Amy would possibly pass sooner rather than later. Shockingly, Amy mysteriously passed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was found at the end of a staircase by her servants with what was believed to be a broken neck. The coroner who evaluated her found&nbsp;deep puncture wounds in her head. Which clearly proved she was hit in order to make such a fall. Due to this, most people believe Queen&nbsp;Elizabeth&nbsp;I and Robert Dudley conspired and likely had Amy taken out. All of this to be together. Of course, divorce was not as easy a concept at the time. So this was the only way they saw to be together. Due to royals being above the law, even if she would have been found to have done the deed herself, she would never go to prison or lose her title as Queen. At least she wasn't as bad as her sister or father. Check a history book to get that.</p><h2 id=the-love-and-party-life-of-prince-george><strong>The Love And Party Life Of Prince George&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Prince George, Duke of Kent, is not well-known to people outside of the United Kingdom or England in particular. However, due to being a Prince and someone very near the throne it made total sense for eyeballs to be on him. Even dating back to the early 1900's. While no social media and cell phone cameras existed at the time to catch George in public, the Prince had several rumors spread about him. Rumors claimed he met up with both men and women in romantic rendezvou.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While monarchs having relations with men and women is by no means a first with Prince George, things were different at this time. England's law at the time was that people of the same gender could not be involved together. While The Royal Family is above the law, it was scandalous, to say the least, that George would parade around doing this. They would not have cared if it was only women, as most would write it off as a guy just being a guy at that time. But the idea of men and women?</p><p>He was also someone who enjoyed the party life beyond "relations" if you will. This ultimately led to something odd. Prince George was part of the Military, which while not a demand for any royal to do, is considered respectable. George would be on a standard military plane ride which ultimately ended in a crash that took the life of the Prince. Conspiracy theories have persisted since the deadly crash happened. Was George too much for the family? Was this aircraft taken down on the direction of the monarchy? Many believe it to be so.

For the most part, he is. He joined the Armed Forces when he never had to as well, and it makes sense for people to like the guy. He's a fun party type who never seems to go too far when at them, well...most of the time. The real issue with Harry is that he seems to lack a proper filter and has shown racial tendencies at times. In 2009, a tape made its way to the public that included the Prince using slurs with his army buddies.</p><p>The footage made the national and international news. While Harry did issue a public apology, his lifestyle and constant foot-in-mouth issues have made the family quite angry with him. Similar to others like him in the past, there is a thought that Harry may not get away with this for long. Sadly he continued to show some absence of mind with racial actions. That has made his recent engagement to beautiful actress Megan Markle so important for the Prince.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Megan is of mixed heritage, she is also considered to be well put-together and perfect to have among the royals.&nbsp;With the Prince now having a marriage to look forward to, he is now on the positive side for the family. Now that the marriage has become international news, it seems that Harry may finally settle down to a point that The Royal Family does not have to worry. Harry likely will end up adding more to the family, which in the end only continues the monarchy for years to come. Despite all of this, he cannot escape his past. Yet he can avoid these mistakes in the future.</p><h2 id=princess-diana-s-planned-passing><strong>Princess Diana's&nbsp;planned passing</strong></h2><p>Likely one of the biggest rumors in England since the death of the beloved Princess Diana comes from her sad passing. Diana passed away in a car wreck in 1997. After years of major issues in the family due to Charles and Diana's relationship being on the rocks, the two divorced in 1996. This divorce would rock the English monarchy and the world, but of course, it was well-known both were having&nbsp;relationships&nbsp;with different people on the side. Including Charles, who would end up marrying his mistress, Camille in 2005. Though reports of their relationship for years prior was known.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Diana would engage in a well-known relationship, but the two did not work out. Thus causing a rift. Upon the divorce from Charles, Diana began dating a man by the name of Al Fayed. He was the son of a billionaire. Tragically both Fayed and Diana passed in the infamous car accident, thus stirring up rumors of how it went down. It was said that The Royal Family massively disapproved of this relationship, despite Charles having a new lover. With Diana no longer connected to the family, some feel there was a cause for people to consider the car accident was not really an "accident."</p><p>In February of 1998, some pretty big skeptics had a right to talk. It was stated by Mohamed Al-Fayed, owner of the Paris Ritz where Henry Paul (Diana's security and driver) had worked, that the crash had been planned. He publicly accused Prince Charles of being behind the incident, though he could never prove it. While in 2008, Mohamed would renounce his claims after a long-term investigation...people still believe there was some sort of planning that went into the accident. It does have suspicious timing for sure.

Several people from the Islamic, Jewish, and now Christian world had debates over their books. Many monks, priests, and others thought they had true books from holy men, which clearly were the most important. These debated books became such an issue that fights broke out and several issues persisted. This led Roman Emperor Constantine The Great to do something about it. The former Pagan, now devout Christian due to his belief in seeing a cross in a winning battle, wanted one book for all to follow.</p><p>That led us to the Christian Bible to be formed after meeting with several heads of the religious sector. All other religious books were to be thrown out, burned, or destroyed. If caught with them you could be taken&nbsp;out by soldiers. So this led to many deaths. Some monks were even buried with their favorite translation. That is why numerous people over the years from this time had books like this with them. From the Book of Judas to many others. Fast-Foward to the 1600's and King James of England wanted an English translation for the Church of England. So in 1611, it would be released to the religious heads to use in churches. The problem?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These priests and ministers added to the bible to fit the narrative of the day, some had generations before (some unknown at the time). The King James' Bible was one that had been altered by priests and church heads and then distributed out with that added text. Then more added to it by the English. When the book managed to get to the printing presses so that more could have the Bible, this altered English text was present inside them. This on top of the lack of understandable translations for phrases and meanings from previous generations. What might be worse is that King James is said to have known of the English alterations. Meaning he knew the Holy Bible was messed with and did nothing.</p><h2 id=jack-the-ripper-was-a-royal><strong>Jack The Ripper Was A Royal?</strong></h2><p>While likely only a rumor among the people of The UK, this does actually reserve some slight belief. As many know by now, Jack the Ripper is one of the most notorious serial killers in world history. Most of the people he took out were what he believed to be the scum of the Earth. Some say he felt that he was above them, all due to coming from some sort of upper-class upbringing. He&nbsp;never went after a noblewoman of any type.&nbsp;During this period, women were usually always smaller than the men.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the same exists today, it was never a rule when it came to noblewomen. Those of The Royal Family or Noble birth ate very well. That included women, who would sometimes be bigger than the men they were married to. Low come women were normally skinny. Many felt Jack went after these women due to his feelings of them, but also due to the ease of which it was to hurt them. In connection to all of this, many believe the reason Jack rarely went for the upper-class was due to knowing many of them.</p><p>The rumor is that Queen Victoria's grandson Prince Albert was secretly Jack the Ripper. It makes sense why he went after the lower-class if you think about it. Due to a royal being above the law, it also explains why Jack was never found or brought to justice for his crimes. To add fuel to the fire, it was widely known Albert had a mental illness. This can explain the issue a bit for people who could never understand why Jack did what he did. Prince Albert also&nbsp;passed 3 to 4 years after Jack The Ripper stopped his actions.

Either way, you think about it, this is something that becomes a bit odd to see. We all know that Kate Middleton has married Prince William. The Duchess will one day be Queen of England while her husband serves as King. The two have had children together, bringing heirs to the throne for years to come. What you might not know is that Kate planned to meet William for a long time, and even switched schools in order to run into him.</p><p>The Prince is no fool, as many women wanted to be with the guy. It automatically makes them a royal when they get married. Though what is odd is that Kate clearly wanted to meet the Prince and had a very good plan to make it happen. Before all of this, she was accepted into The University of Edinburgh, her first choice of schools. Yet she would actually decline the offer to go and waited a year to get into The University of St. Andrews, the same time as she knew William would be attending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kate is a beautiful woman today and was ever since William knew her. Clearly, he would be taken by her beauty. While it is not completely known if Kate planned all this out to meet and get into a relationship with the Prince, it does seem that way. She succeeded regardless, so one has to hand it to her for securing a Prince. She also came from an upper-middle-class family. She has reminded a lot of people of the late Princess Diana, William's mother. While clearly, men do not want to marry their mother, it is quite weird that Kate has so many similarities to Diana.</p><h2 id=king-henry-viii-the-guy-we-all-hated><strong>King Henry VIII&nbsp;the guy we all hated</strong></h2><p>Likely one of the most famous Kings in history is King Henry VIII. Known as a renaissance man,&nbsp;he was one of the most charismatic kings in history. He did a lot while on the throne but is the example of why too much power corrupts. In fact, he not only embarrassed the crown but also embarrassed the family before him. Henry was married to Catherine&nbsp;of Aragon originally, a woman of older note. Henry and Catherine came together in an arranged marriage, so he never truly felt love for her as he and she had hoped. The rub at the time? The Church had far too much power.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At that time, the church did not allow divorce. Once Henry married Catherine, that was the end of that to the church. Even the King himself was bound by the church. This led the King to separate the church from the authority of The Pope. This would take The Pope's power down exponentially. Henry then made himself the "Supreme Head of the Church of England." He was able to get his marriage annulled, and he would go on to marry multiple women. He would do this mostly due to never seemingly having a male heir to the throne with his first few wives.</p><p>He would marry five more times. Two of these women would be executed: Ann Boleyn and Catherine Howard. Two others were also annulled (Jane Seymor died after giving birth). Meanwhile, Catherine Parr, his last wife, outlived him. Most of these marriages would last three years or less. He would eventually have multiple children, but only one son. After Henry's passing, his son would succeed him at the throne, becoming Edward VI. Doing so as a boy, around age 10. Yet his reign lasted a mere five and a half years. This due to falling ill, which would cause his passing at age 15. A shake-up in the kingdom would follow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-iii-and-his-paranoia><strong>Richard III And His Paranoia</strong></h2><p>It is well-known by now that The Royal Family is above the law, and they surely use that freedom in a major way. However, Richard III likely used his power as King in the worst way possible. He was known for making some very weird decisions, especially when it concerned himself or the kingdom he was controlling. To be fair, he had some reason. During his reign, there were two rebellions that took place. However, they only seemed to add supporters due to how he ruled. Before all of this happened, however, he lusted for power and the throne. Yet there was a big problem that got in the way of this.</p><p>He was not the first in line to the throne or even second, considering his brother Edward IV was King and had two sons that could inherit the throne. Sadly, his brother would pass, and due to death, it made sense his heirs would take over. Edward V, a 12-year-old, was then going to be made King of England. Yet in 1483, before Edward V could even get the crown, things changed.&nbsp;It was found that his parents' marriage was invalid,&nbsp;being declared "bigamous." This made he and his sibling illegitimate, according to the Church and the Assembly of Lords and commoners. They would recommend the brother, Richard, for the throne instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With neither being able to take the throne due to this controversy, the boys saw their uncle Richard III be made King.&nbsp;The following day after he is made King, on the orders of the&nbsp;Richard III himself, his two young nephews(12 and 9) would be taken to the Tower of London. Never to return. While it is thought Richard did not do it himself, but others would on his behalf, the King's nephews would be taken from the world. Literally, Richard is responsible for the death of his two young nephews. Neither of which were even eligible for the throne already. Yet the paranoid nature of the King led him to take his nephews out before they could do it to him. He would last a mere 2 years on the throne, being taken out in battle by Henry Tudor. Thus starting the Tudor dynasty for years to come. Karma?</p><h2 id=king-george-iii-and-his-many-issues><strong>King George III And&nbsp;his many issues</strong></h2><p>King George III is remembered for certain reasons. Truly it depends who his biographer might be to know or understand his role as King during this period. He served on the throne from 1760-1820. While it was done before him, the kingdom expanded quite well under George. So much so, most all of his generals are remembered from their time and successes in English history. Including the popular General Cornwallis. Under his rule, England became a dominant power. They would take control of India and add several other nations to the commonwealth. Some still there to this day. England would even beat Napoleon Bonaparte of France in a battle to completely dominate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They did not win in everything, however. Most Americans believe, today, that George was a tyrant. History backs up this claim, due to the massive taxes he would put on those who went to the new world, today known as the United States. From taxing tea to going after various other items. They even withheld items from going to the new world simply out&nbsp;of uncaring nature. This led the people to declare their independence. After the American Revolution, the crown lost power due to the faith lost in George.</p><p>However, there was some real loss in faith before this and most certainly afterward. King George III had a mental illness. Historians say that the mental issue was likely caused by&nbsp;a blood disease called porphyria. This disease affects the skin and nervous system and was an issue in England for some in this time, so it does add up. The issue is that his mental illness affected much of his rule and actions on the throne. He once even thought a tree was the King of Prussia and would stop to talk to him for a bit. He would pass-away after a 58-hour point of madness where he spoke absolute craziness, before slipping into a coma and passing at the age of 81.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=queen-victoria-from-marrying-her-cousin-to-her-relationship-with-her-manservant><strong>Queen Victoria From Marrying Her Cousin To Her&nbsp;relationship With&nbsp;Her Manservant</strong></h2><p>Queen Victoria is remembered heavily from English history for her impressively long reign from 1837-1901. She took the throne at the age of 18, following her father's passing. Her taking of the throne was kind of odd. Her father was the fourth son of King George III. Due to all four of the sons dying, including her grandfather, then father, then uncle William IV...she took the throne. She was known to rule relatively fair and was usually remembered as a kind, respectable, and understanding. She was known for her strict morality as well. But things were not as they seemed.</p><p>While political power had been minimal by this point, Victoria took the throne and decided to get involved in the political sector privately. Meanwhile, she became an icon of England publicly. From the art, buildings, and industrial revolution that happened around her to fashion and rule. Victoria simply was part of a lot, though not all good. She would marry her FIRST cousin, Albert in 1840. She loved Albert, and they even had children together.&nbsp;In this time, it was thought keeping royal blood connection was important. However now we, of course, know why family members do not have children today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The real weird part happened after Albert's passing. Victoria would engage in a lustful&nbsp;relationship with her manservant and commoner, John Brown. He took care of livestock at the Balmoral Castle. It was said that the two had a very strong connection and the mutual love was present in a major way. Brown would pass and Victoria was vastly depressed afterward, claiming to no longer "have a strong arm to lean on." This is clearly something that would be above the monarchy today. Though they have engaged in relationships outside the noble-types, it's usually always of the upper or upper-middle class.</p><h2 id=edward-viii-gave-up-the-throne-for-his-beloved><strong>Edward VIII Gave Up The Throne For His Beloved</strong></h2><p>While this may not be a dark secret, it's considered to be something The Royal Family looks down on today. Though, many of us will find it to be very sweet and actually quite a lovely gesture from Edward VIII. Edward was considered to be a great person by many. In fact, while he did become the Prince of Wales by 16-years-old...he did not want to sit by during the fighting. So he took part in the English Armed Forces during World War I.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was first in line for the throne, so when his father passed in January of 1936, Edward would become the King of England. Not one to care for the court system or constitution of the day, he caused some uproar in power. Likely none more than his engagement to a woman named Wallis Simpson, an American woman. While the people of England did not care for his marriage to an American, the real issue was not her nationality. The problem was that she had been divorced from her first husband and was in a current divorce proceeding with her second husband.</p><p>The Prime Ministers of The UK, among several others, opposed the marriage. The biggest disagreement came from the Church of England who opposed the marriage heavily. They claim that it would be wrong to see the King marry a woman divorced twice from two living ex-husbands. Knowing the British government, he realized he would not be able to marry Simpson and remain King. At only 326 days on the throne, he gave it up to marry Wallis. It would go to his brother George VI, the father of the current Queen of England, Elizabeth II. Edward is remembered as a man who gave the throne up for love. But there was that whole Nazi thing, sooo....</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-current-royal-family-may-not-be-royal-after-all><strong>The Current Royal Family May Not Be Royal After All</strong></h2><p>Remember Richard III from earlier? While he may not be the best of people, he plays an important role in the English monarchy. In 2012, the remains of the former King were found in a Leicester parking lot of all places. The weird part? The DNA testing would not link him to any paternal relatives. This makes Richard III a man born of a relationship that broke the royal chain. No wonder he wanted to take out those nephews, huh? The real issue with this is not so much that awful human, Richard III. It ultimately has to do with the "Royal Chain of History."</p><p>If by chance the royal chain of descendants was broken somewhere along the way as it is assumed by this test, many Queens and Kings did not have the royal right to rule. Basically, they would not be of royal blood. That even included Queen Elizabeth II, the current Queen of England. This would then include Prince Charles, her son. It would also affect both other living Princes, William and Harry. While this is not so much an issue for people around the world, it affects the monarchy in a massive way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone who has been on the throne before Richard III was believed to have had some relation to the noble blood in the family somewhere in history. Whether that means they were related to a King, Queen, Duke, Dutchess, Prince, Princess, or whatever it might have been. After the Richard III incident, all people that have a connection to him in any way would be invalid. The real question is, who would be on the throne if not the current? It appears this goes back hundreds of years. So do not expect a change to the throne now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmismJp6s7vYmqNmnpGitq3FjGtsZquVmL%2BmwNJmqK6dlaN6prjIs5ibnaSdeqS71KWbZqyVobluwdJmmJunpal6tbTEZqSoppGnsKnFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adam-levine-debuts-anti-cologne-line-of-fragrances-i-want-to-compete-with-dior.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adam Levine Debuts &amp;quot;Anti-Cologne&amp;quot; Line of Fragrances: &amp;quot;I Want to Compete With Dior&amp;quot;">&larr;
