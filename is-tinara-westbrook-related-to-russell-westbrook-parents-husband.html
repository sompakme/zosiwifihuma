The Seattle SuperSonics selected him with the fourth overall choice in the 2008 NBA Draft; they later moved to Oklahoma City the following week.</p><p>The 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics saw Westbrook earn gold medals while playing for the American national team. He was traded to the Houston Rockets in 2019 and spent one season there before moving again to the Washington Wizards in 2020. He was traded to the Lakers after spending a season in Washington.</p><h2 id=tinara-westbrook-relationship-with-boyfriend-donovan-mitchell><span class=ez-toc-section id=tinara-westbrook-relationship-with-boyfriend-donovan-mitchell></span> Tinara Westbrook Relationship With Boyfriend Donovan Mitchell<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Official confirmation of Tinara Westbrook’s relationship with Donovan Mitchell has been made by her using her social media account.</p><p>Tinara Westbrook recently posted many pictures with her boyfriend on Instagram to make their relationship official. She included a caption, “I am for you, and you are for me,” which is kind.</p><p>American professional basketball player Donovan Mitchell Jr. competes for the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers. He represented the Louisville Cardinals in college basketball, and in 2017 he was named to the first team All-ACC.</p><p>The Denver Nuggets selected Mitchell with the 13th overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. He was dealt to the Utah Jazz on draft night. During his rookie season, Mitchell was selected for the NBA All-Rookie First Team and triumphed in the Slam Dunk Competition of 2018.</p><h2 id=more-about-donovan-mitchell-jr><span class=ez-toc-section id=more-about-donovan-mitchell-jr></span> More About Donovan Mitchell Jr.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Cleveland core’s oldest member is Mitchell. He turned 26 a few weeks ago. He is eager to work with Darius Garland, 22, Jarrett Allen, 24, and Evan Mobley, 21, who may serve as the team’s face and were both All-Stars last season.</p><p>Mitchell spent his whole time with the Jazz and was a three-time NBA All-Star, but the team never advanced past the second round of the playoffs. In September 2022, he was dealt to the Cavaliers.</p><p>In addition, Mitchell appeared in the 2017–2018 season’s “Rookie on the Rise” film and on the cover of SLAM Magazine. The documentary follows Mitchell as he competes for the Rookie of the Year honor. Mitchell frequently attends games when the New York Mets are not in season. Mitchell’s father, Donovan Sr., has been employed for the Mets for more than 20 years.</p><p>On Instagram, Donovan Mitchell is active. He currently has a huge fan base of 3.5 million followers.</p><h2 id=early-life-of-russell-westbrook-family-and-siblings><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-of-russell-westbrook-family-and-siblings></span> Early Life Of Russell Westbrook Family And Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Russell Westbrook Jr. and Shannon Horton welcomed Westbrook into the world in Long Beach, California. Raynard, his younger brother, is his name. Westbrook and his best friend Khelcey Barrs III aspired to attend UCLA and play together as children growing up in Hawthorne.</p><p>Barrs earned scholarship offers for college at 16, where he was already recognized for his superior basketball talents. Barrs passed away from an enlarged heart while playing pickup basketball in May 2004. Westbrook seems even more determined to succeed after Barrs passes away in honor of his best friend.</p><p>Westbrook, a point guard who was barely 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters) tall and weighed only 140 pounds (64 kg), although he did have huge (size 14) feet, entered Leuzinger High School. He didn’t join the varsity team at his school until his junior year, and it wasn’t until the summer before his senior year that he got his first college recruitment letter. That same summer, Westbrook reached his adult height of 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 meters).</p><p>Westbrook helped them to a 25-4 record in his senior year by averaging 25.1 points, 8.7 rebounds, 3.1 steals, and 2.3 assists. He had 14 double-doubles, eight games with 30 or more points, and a career-high 51 points during that same season.</p><h2 id=tinara-westbrook-went-for-a-vacation-with-her-boyfriend><span class=ez-toc-section id=tinara-westbrook-went-for-a-vacation-with-her-boyfriend></span> Tinara Westbrook Went For A Vacation With Her Boyfriend <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ainge finally moved Mitchell, who developed into an All-Star while playing for the Jazz, to the Cavaliers because he could not take the team farther. But it had no impact on how I was feeling.</p><p>After the team’s media makeup day, Mitchell took advantage of the last opportunity to take a vacation with his longtime girlfriend and shared a snapshot of the two on social media.</p><p>According to information made public by the media, Tinara Westbrook, Mitchell’s girlfriend, is a model. Despite her modest popularity, she has a good appearance and a confident physique.</p><p>The Cavaliers paid a lot of money to get Mitchell, the most significant player in the post-James era, from New York, hoping he would get along better with Dolan and lead the team from the highly competitive East.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKGjYsGqusCrmGavlajBo77OqKJmqpWhrrWxw2arqGWiqsC0sculZLCdo6mvs7vOpGSpmaKau7W%2FjKGsrJqRo7Fuf44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jenna-gribbon-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jenna Gribbon Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
