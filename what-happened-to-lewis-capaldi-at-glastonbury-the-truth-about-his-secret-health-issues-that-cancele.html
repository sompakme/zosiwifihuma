Blessed with an incredible voice, the ability to write lyrics that anyone can relate to, and a lovable personality, Capaldi is the kind of guy that fans can't help but root for.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to all of Capaldi's attributes that make him an incredible performer, it can seem like he has everything going for him. Tragically for Capaldi, however, it turns out that he has been very unfortunate in some ways since he has suffered many health setbacks in recent years. This includes what caused his heartbreaking performance at June 2023's Glastonbury festival and the subsequent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decision to cancel his tour and all work</a> for the foreseeable future...</p><h2 id=what-has-happened-to-lewis-capaldi-39-s-mental-health>What Has Happened To Lewis Capaldi's Mental Health?</h2><p>Once someone becomes incredibly famous, it can be easy for fans to start to think that they've become untouchable. However, considering <a href=#>the health scare Robert De Niro had</a> while filming Meet the Fockers and <a href=#>Bella Hadid's health struggles</a>, that obviously isn't the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lewis-capaldi-after-winning-two-brit-awards.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2019, Lewis Capaldi rose to international fame after his single "Someone You Loved" became a huge hit. Following the success of that song, Capaldi's 2019 album "Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent" turned out to have a slew of other celebrated songs.</p><p>On top of enjoying a massive amount of commercial success, Capaldi's album also was extremely acclaimed, to say the very least. Thanks to how much Capaldi's songs are respected by his peers and fans alike, he has taken home far too many awards to list them all here.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bruce Willis's Health Issues Caused Him To Miss Out On Some Huge Paychecks After Once Being One Of The Highest Paid-Actors In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>With so many people dreaming of doing what Capaldi accomplished, it can be easy to think of him enjoying the spoils of his success. What many people don't seem to realize, however, is that going from anonymous to world-famous and celebrated in months can turn into a nightmare too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Capaldi became a superstar, he has been open about the pressure he feels to live up to the reputation that has been built up around him. As Capaldi explained when he appeared on Rebecca Judd’s "Apple Music" podcast in 2023 to talk about his sophomore album, his songs are more focused on his mental health now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lewis-capaldi-looking-freaked-out.jpg><p>“I think on this album in particular I talk a bit more about my mental health, which has taken a beating over the last little while." Hopefully singing and talking about his struggles will make things easier for Capaldi in the long run. As Capaldi went on to say during the podcast appearance, the pressure he felt <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took a bigger toll on his mental health</a> than anyone knew at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’m managing it better now but I think in 2020 I was kind of glad when we got put in lockdown because I had done my first arena tour in the UK, and we had just done an Australia and Asia tour before that, and I was in a bad way where I was just having panic attacks every single day on stage and I was just shy."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bebe Rexha's Secret Health Battle With Bipolar Disorder And Anxiety Has Changed Her Life Forever, Here's How She Manages It</a></span></p><p>Later in the same podcast appearance, Capaldi said something that communicates how hard he has found it to cope with fame at times. While Capaldi never for a second makes it seem like he doesn't appreciate how fortunate he has been, he told Rebecca Judd that he might have to give his career up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"If it gets to the point where things get worse mentally and I stop kind of looking after myself in that regard, I think that would be a point where I’d be like, ‘I’m just not going to do this anymore’. The main reason I got into music was to play live and if I’m struggling to do that ever, I think that’s where I’m in trouble, because otherwise that’s the payoff, that’s the point of doing it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lewis-capaldi-looking-concerned-as-he-jokes-around.jpg><p>Capaldi continued, "At that point, if it felt like it was becoming something that I was not into or was causing me stress or I hated (it), then that’s when I would probably pack it in.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In June 2023, Capaldi's warning about how he might have to walk away from music became all too real for his fans. Earlier in the month, Capaldi canceled all of his upcoming shows and explained by saying he was "struggling" after the release of his successful second album. At the time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Capaldi explained that he was going to "rest and recover"</a>.</p><h2 id=what-has-happened-to-lewis-capaldi-39-s-physical-health>What Has Happened To Lewis Capaldi's Physical Health?</h2><p>From the moment that Lewis Capaldi became a superstar, fans have adored him for several reasons. That said, there is no doubt that one of his greatest attributes as a performer has been how incredible he is when fans see him live.</p><p>Tragically for Capaldi and all of his fans, however, the incredibly talented singer has revealed that his ability to play live has been faltering in recent months. First off, Capaldi announced that he'd been diagnosed with Tourette’s syndrome in September 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bob Barker's Partner Revealed Health Care Professionals Are Stunned By How Little Medication The Former Host Takes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Capaldi explained during his Netflix documentary, his Tourette's symptoms have been "getting quite bad". In Capaldi's case, his symptoms get worse when he performs which is a problem since he makes involuntary sounds and experiences shoulder twitches.</p><p>When Capaldi was later talking to The Times about the situation, he said something very dramatic. “I’m trying to get on top of that. If I can’t, I’m f***ed." When Capaldi was interviewed for his documentary, he revealed how his struggles with Tourette's symptoms started.</p><p>“This twitch became out of control and it was awful. It was absolutely horrific. I started to get in my head about these pressures. ‘F***, there’s skin in the game now’. Rather than me just singing my silly little songs. Other people are depending on me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lewis-capaldi-singing.jpg><p>After Capaldi took his break in early June-2023, he made his return to the stage when he performed at Glastonbury later that month. Sadly for an extremely apologetic Capaldi, his voice began to falter partway through his performance. After gutting his way through several songs, Capaldi ultimately left the stage earlier than intended and reportedly he looked dejected.</p><p>Needless to say, being onstage and losing your ability to perform sounds like a nightmare. However, based on how the BBC described <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the audience's reaction to Capaldi losing his voice</a>, fans will still love him if he can't perform live anymore or even if he retires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The audience lent him their vocal support, willing him along and belting out the words. They wanted him to know it was OK, that they were there for him. It was a wonderful, communal display of both the Glastonbury spirit, and the genuine public affection for Capaldi, who walked around the stage, singing when he could manage, and taking in the view."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brjEsKCsZZOWvaK4w6JkoaGjYsCmr9Geq2aglZa5tbSMoqqsrZWoerW71KucrayVqHqouMCsq6imkqq%2Funs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-sadie-soverall-parents-meet-fate-the-winx-saga-cast-mother-carolyn-tripp-and-father.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Sadie Soverall Parents?
