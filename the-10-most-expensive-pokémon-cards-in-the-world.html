The franchise has continued for twenty years now and as long as the game/anime stays popular, they'll be Pokémon cards too. But those who have been around since the beginning, have an unfair advantage, older cards are more valuable.</p><h2 id=grand-party-trainer-3-000>Grand Party Trainer($3,000)</h2><p>Starting off our list is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Party Trainer Certification card</a>. With the making of the Pokémon Fan Club in April of 1999, the "Passport Challenge" was introduced to those who attended the Challenge Road '99 summer events between July-August.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Participants who collected 50 stamps from Pokémon trading card battles before the end of the campaign were entered into a prize lottery, which was held at the Regional Champion Road 2000.

This card sold online for $3,000 as recently as November 2019.</p><h2 id=warm-pikachu-uniqlo-kids-5-000>Warm Pikachu Uniqlo Kids($5,000)</h2><p>This XY Promo card was released in Japan in 2014. Four versions of this card featuring a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu</a> bundled up for winter was given as part of the Uniqlo Kids x Pokémon Trading Card Game XY promotional campaign, which ran throughout December of 2014.</p><p>One unique version of this card was included with any online order of 1 of 6 children's Pokémon Heat Tech shirts from participating Uniqlo clothing stores. All variations have the Uniqlo logo in the bottom left corner. This adorable card sold online not long ago for $5,000 in September of this year.</p><h2 id=rayquaza-holographic-gold-star-8-500>Rayquaza Holographic Gold Star($8,500)</h2><p>Gold Star cards are marks with an embossed foil star next to the Pokémon's name. They also feature shiny/alternative color variations of the Pokémon. Gold Star Pokémon, in particular, are extremely hard to find because there are only about 1 in every 72 packs or so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Incredibly Expensive Yu-Gi-Oh Cards...

It also shows the last sales of the trading card was on Ebay for $8,500 bucks on September 25th of this year. Other similar sales put this price in its average range. This is definitely a card worth holding on to.</p><h2 id=tamamushi-university-magikarp-10-000>Tamamushi University Magikarp($10,000)</h2><p>Only available in Japan, it was given as a prize through the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tamamushi </a>University Hyper Test campaign held in June 1998. The event was publicized in Shogakukan's Magazine (for elementary-age children) in the form of a series of tests they could complete and send in within a limited time period.</p><p>Those that passed were sent an invitation to a two-day conference in Osaka.

Even though there are several in existence, this is still a prized card to own. Some are misprinted with the Fighting elemental type symbol instead of the Fire-type symbol. But all have the misprint of a missing capital letter in the Roaring Flame attack.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It should say "Discard all Energy cards," but the "E" is not capitalized.

This unusual change was due to the Pokémon craze dying off at this point in 2002. Because of this, Neo Destiny cards weren't printed in large quantities, increasing the whole set's worth. However, it was the ever-popular Charizard and its offbeat style that stood to avid Pokecollectors.</p><p>Even though not entirely uncommon, the collectability of this card keeps its sales high, selling for $15,000 in June of&nbsp; 2018.</p><h2 id=pok-dex-1st-edition-30-000>Pokédex 1st Edition($30,000)</h2><p>Pokédex (or Pokémon Illustrated Encyclopedia as it's known in Japan) was originally released in the US in the very first Base Set. This card spotlighting Pokémon's most <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">important piece of equipment</a> has been re-released several times since its first debut but it's the original first edition that is the most valuable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Pokémon Cards That Are Worth Way More Than You Think</a></span></p><p>The card has been listed as high as $500,000 dollars but seems to sell more frequently at the $30,000 dollar range.
