While she and Victor Houston are no longer together, he lives a fascinating lifestyle that her fans will definitely want to hear about.</p><h2 id=what-is-camila-mendes-39-ex-victor-houston-doing-now>What Is Camila Mendes' Ex Victor Houston Doing Now?</h2><p>Camila Mendes' ex-boyfriend <strong>Victor Houston is involved with two bars in New York City</strong>. His Instagram bio mentions two places: Micro Heaven and Lassiez Faire. Micro Haven is described as a "listening bar" and "microclub" on Instagram, and Laissez Faire opened in February 2023. In an Instagram post from August 2023, Houston called Laissez Faire "a contemporary iteration of the hotel club/lounge."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From looking at Victor Houston's Instagram account, it seems clear that he lives a great lifestyle and has a lot of fun. While his net worth is unknown, he seems to be more than comfortable, and this enables him to travel where he wants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/victor-houston-camila-mendes.jpg><p>Houston's life includes a lot of travel and getting together with friends. He must be earning a great salary that allows him to travel whenever he wants to as this seems to be a huge part of his routine. In 2019, he posted photos from London and Paris, and in April 2021, he traveled to St Maarten.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Camila-Mendes-Admitted-To-Being-Similar-From-Her-Do-Revenge-Character-Drea.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Camila Mendes Admitted To Being Similar To Her Do Revenge Character Drea</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Camila Mendes' high school dating life was quite similar to Drea's in Do Revenge.</span><p>In July 2023, Houston shared photos of a beach trip that he took with a large group of friends. In June 2022, he posted photos of himself on several Greek beaches, which looked like an incredible vacation. He wrote in the Instagram caption:</p><p>"Guys! I found these hidden gem islands in Greece!

Several sources reported that she chatted about him in an interview with Nylon. The actress said that she was in a relationship with someone who wasn't part of Hollywood:</p><p>"It's somebody completely out of the industry. It's funny because I'm more hesitant to talk about it because I don't want him to read this...
