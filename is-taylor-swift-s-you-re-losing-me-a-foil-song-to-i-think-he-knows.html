Throughout their relationship, the pair opted to keep out of the spotlight, often walking red carpets solo even when attending the same events. Shortly after the breakup, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Swift’s celebrity status contributed to the twosome calling it quits.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans have since recognized that <a href=#>Swift and Alwyn’s romance</a> may have turned rocky <a href=#>long before they</a> officially parted ways, with Swift’s anxieties around her publicized life being too much to handle appearing in songs like “The Archer,” “Peace” and more.</p><p>While Swift has never confirmed who her songs are about, fans are sure to get more insight into her and Alwyn’s relationship when The Tortured Poets Department hits shelves on Friday, April 19.</p><p>“I needed to make it. It was<a href=#> really a lifeline</a> for me,” she told concertgoers at a February Eras Tour show in Melbourne, Australia. “It sort of reminded me of why songwriting is something that actually gets me through life and I’ve never had an album where I’ve needed songwriting more than I needed it on Tortured Poets.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCsZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqcBuxc6uqZ5lnKTAqrrGZqSeZZFis7C1y2aqqKaXYsGwechmq6GhnqB6qbGMpKWor6Nk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jovenel-moise-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jovenel Moise Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
