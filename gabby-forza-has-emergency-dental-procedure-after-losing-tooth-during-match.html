Forza is getting some attention for the match for a variety of reasons. First, she landed an impressive three-wrestler fallaway slam, but she also lost a tooth during the bout.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Forza checked in on Twitter and said she’s OK, and she was able to see an ER dentist today. She had an emergency root canal on Friday, but expects to be back in the ring for a scheduled appearance on Sunday night.</p><p>“Thank you everyone that checked on me after I got my tooth kicked out of my face. Thats wrestling baby!!?? Here to report I was able to get to an ER dentist today & got an emergency root canal done,” Gabby Forza wrote on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. “On the mend then back to Worcester on Sunday for Heavy Lies the crown??”</p><p>According to the American Association of Endodontists, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">root canal</a> is “a dental procedure to remove inflamed or infected pulp on the inside of the tooth which is then carefully cleaned and disinfected, then filled and sealed. Root canal treatment is designed to eliminate bacteria from the infected root canal, prevent reinfection of the tooth and save the natural tooth.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2>Road To Recovery</h2><p>Gabby Forza has dealt with a wide variety of injuries in her lifetime. Most of them can be attributed to her football career. In October 2020, though, a serious car accident would put Forza’s physical and mental strength to the ultimate test.</p><p>After getting hit by a Mack truck, Forza was left with several injuries. This included a lacerated liver, fractures to her neck and wrist, a severe concussion, and two broken legs. Due to the extensive damage done to her body, Forza was rushed to the hospital, later undergoing multiple surgeries and intensive physical therapy.</p><p>During a recent&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with WrestleZone’s Ella Jay,</a>&nbsp;Forza spoke about her lengthy road to recovery and regaining her ability to walk. Despite being sidelined for over a year, Forza now views the experience through a more hopeful or positive lens.</p><p>“It’s something I’m really proud of, but I try to not make it like the main point of who I am,” Forza said. “I did get through it and I got past it, but it’s to a point where I meet so many people now that they don’t know that about me, and I’m like, ‘Oh yeah, so I have a lot of injury history’. I’ve broken both my legs at the same time as a highly active person. That was during the year of COVID, so it was 2020. No one is seeing each other. No one that knows me regularly sees me.”</p><h2 id=h-i-think-that-saved-my-life>“I think that saved my life”</h2><p>“Come back, everyone starts to see each other in 2021, and I’m walking, but I’m not off crutches. I have a scooter and people are like, ‘Oh, what happened?’ Like, ‘Oh, forgot to tell you, I got hit by a Mack truck. My insides and outsides are all rearranged.’ Surface level, I looked okay. I have a really good mindset about these things. It was terrible to go through [though]. I have a higher pain tolerance now because I experienced the worst pain of my life for months straight. So it wasn’t like the impact of an accident hurt, it was months of the pain getting worse. Then I think your body just chemically has to adapt to it. So I guess it helped me in the fact that I came back from that and started pursuing two very physically demanding sports.”</p><p>“But it’s a lot to put yourself through, whether you got hit by a Mack truck or you didn’t. So I have to sometimes remind people that I have limits,” Forza continued. “No one wants me to stop playing football, but being a linebacker is a high-collision position. It’s not like being a wide receiver or a quarterback where you have big people protecting you. I am the problem on the field. I create that impact every time. So for me, I had the goal, prior to this accident, of trying out for the National Women’s Tackle Football team for the second time and making it and becoming an Olympic gold medalist.”</p><p>Forza said she was in the best shape of her life, noting she was working out “to be durable.” As it turns out, Forza believes being in such great shape saved her life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsaW5tYWK0oq7BsmSfp6Kvrm60wKxknqWVp7SmusKyZJ2dnqmurXnPq6acnZSqv6Z5wJ%2Brnqpdoby0tc2gZK2nn6m1brDUq6Cnn12irrWvxw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./here-s-how-tom-selleck-built-a-50-million-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's How Tom Selleck Built A $50 Million Net Worth">&larr;
