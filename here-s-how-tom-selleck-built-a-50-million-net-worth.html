With his rugged good looks, iconic mustache, and charming yet tough guy persona, Selleck became an instant heartthrob and household name during the peak of his fame in the 80s. Though he is now in his late 70s, Selleck has remained a <a href=#>beloved star with an acting career</a> spanning over five decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><b>From iconic roles in television series like </b><b><i>Magnum, P.I.</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>F.R.I.E.N.D.S</i></b><b> to memorable appearances in movies such as </b><b><i>Three Men and a Baby,</i></b><b> Selleck's talent and charisma have propelled him to a $45 Million fortune.</b></p><h2 id=a-look-at-selleck-s-early-life>A Look At Selleck's Early Life</h2><p>Born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1945, Selleck had a fairly normal middle-class upbringing. His father was a real estate investor, and his mother was a housewife. As a talented basketball player, Selleck earned a basketball scholarship to the University of Southern California as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walk of Fame</a>. However, after his junior year, he decided to drop out and follow his true passion - acting. He studied acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse and supported himself by modeling and starring in commercials while attending countless auditions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Selleck got his first big break in 1969 when he was cast in a recurring role on the TV show <i>Lancer</i>. Though the show was short-lived, it gave him the experience and exposure needed to land more prominent roles. He appeared in several TV movies throughout the 70s, including <i>Daughters of Satan, Sarge</i>, and <i>The Seven Minutes</i>. Though he was working steadily, these were mostly B movies that did not make him a major star. His big break would come just a decade after first trying to make it in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=the-role-of-magnum-p-i-in-boosting-tom-s-career>The Role Of Magnum P.I. In Boosting Tom's Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1980, Selleck achieved nationwide fame when he was cast as Thomas Magnum in CBS’s new hit show <i>Magnum P.I</i>.

He also became the face of brands like Pepsi and American Express, further amplifying his fame and wealth.
