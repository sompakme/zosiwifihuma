David largely amassed his wealth due to his employment as a <a href=#>late-night talk show host</a>. With the success of his NBC talk show The David Letterman Show, which he launched in 1980, made him a salary of $1 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="David Letterman's Car Collection Will Blow Your Mind" href=#>David Letterman's Car Collection Will Blow Your Mind</a></span></p><h2 id=letterman-s-early-life-and-controversies>Letterman's Early Life And Controversies</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>David Letterman, whose real name is David Michael Letterman, was born on April 12, 1947, in Indianapolis, Indiana. His parents were Harry Joseph Letterman, a florist, and Dorothy, a church secretary. His sisters are Gretchen and Janice. Letterman worked in Indianapolis as a radio talk-show host, the host of a children's program and a late-night movie show, a news anchor, and a television weatherman, where his sense of humor was already apparent if not necessarily appreciated. Letterman received his B.A. in radio and television from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. He reportedly angered his superiors one evening by congratulating a tropical storm on becoming a hurricane.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Letterman has a reputation</a> for skillfully hiding his sexual relationships and personal life from the media. After his divorce from Michele Cook in 1977, he reportedly had a relationship with writer and comedienne Merrill Markoe. In the middle of the 1980s, he then started dating production manager Regina Lasko. The traits that distinguish Letterman most are his gap-toothed self-mockery and his boisterous, sardonic, and occasionally cynical sense of humor. <a href=#>Many talk show hosts</a> and comedians who came after him were inspired by his unorthodox approach and brand of humor, which developed a cult following.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-letterman-as-a-rising-talent-in-hollywood>David Letterman As A Rising Talent In Hollywood</h2><p>Letterman relocated to Los Angeles in 1975 and began penning episodes of famous sitcoms, including Good Times. When he started performing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, whom he has subsequently referred to as his mentor, that was when he got his big break. He started appearing on Carson's show frequently in 1978, and in 1980 he was given a chance to host his own daytime program, The David Letterman Show. NBC-TV decided to give the young comic a late-night show to air after host Johnny Carson's <a href=#>show called&nbsp;The Tonight Show</a>, even though the show only ran for three months. The late-late show hour fit Letterman's brazen and eccentric humor nicely. By combining the typical talk-show ingredients of celebrity guests and music, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Late Night with David Letterman quickly gained popularity</a> with a young audience. The Top Ten List, Stupid Pet Tricks, and Stupid Human Tricks were among Letterman's trademark segments. He frequently threw pencils at the camera and the set behind him, breaking the fake glass with a cued crash sound.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also became well-known for his parody routines that mocked his bandleader Paul Shaffer and the other members of The World's Most Dangerous Band like Biff Henderson and general weirdo Larry Melman for their glaring lack of acting talent. He agreed to a hefty contract to host the Jay Leno-competing Late Show with David Letterman. It was his big break when David Letterman started appearing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Later, he was allowed to host his own show, Late Night with David Letterman, where he ran such well-liked segments as Stupid Pet Tricks. Letterman moved to CBS in 1992 to take over as host of the Late Show for the following two decades after NBC replaced Carson with Jay Leno.</p><h2 id=becoming-one-of-the-most-successful-hosts-in-hollywood>Becoming&nbsp;One Of The Most Successful Hosts In Hollywood</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That same year, he also established his own production company, Worldwide Pants, which invested in his new show. His public personas, salary, and earnings from his production firm Worldwide Pants, account for a sizable portion of his net worth. Many additional displays, including Everybody Loves Raymond, were produced by this company. Letterman extended his agreement with CBS in December 2006, continuing to preside over Late Show with David Letterman through the fall of 2010. He earned an estimated $40 million in 2007 and was listed as the 17th wealthiest man in the entertainment sector by Forbes. Letterman was ranked No. 14 on Forbes' 2009 list of the most influential figures in entertainment.</p><p>One of the secrets to <a href=#>the talk show host's wealth and influence</a>, according to the magazine, is his Peabody Award-winning business Worldwide Pants. This is in addition to producing Letterman's show that created hit sitcoms, including The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Everybody Loves Raymond. In October 2017, as a celebration of individuals who have impacted American society, Letterman received a The Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. This recognition was given to him because of his exemplary performance in a comedy. His wealth grows even this time as he acquires a ranch in Montana, where he raises bison and other real estate holdings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="19 Secrets About Jimmy Fallon He Would Never Share On His Show" href=#>19 Secrets About Jimmy Fallon He Would Never Share On His Show</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Idol Persona</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ball State University</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMnZivoZRiuabA056pppmeYq%2B2tcutZKGho2KBdnyMpqClpJmku26yzqurrqaVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ice-spice-s-butt-exposed-in-betty-boop-costume-causes-stir-online.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ice Spice's Butt Exposed In Betty Boop Costume, Causes Stir Online">&larr;
