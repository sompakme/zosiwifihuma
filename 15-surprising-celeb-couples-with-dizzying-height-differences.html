The way that they have to stoop or stand on their tip-toes to kiss is downright adorable! I, myself, am a tiny woman with a tall husband, and everyone always tells us how sweet and funny we look together. When the couple with a big height difference is famous, it's even better. I especially love seeing female celebs walking down the red carpet in their fanciest high heels. This either makes them tower over their partner or helps them look only slightly less tiny, compared to their giant spouse. It's so sweet that despite their mismatched heights, they always look so very much in love!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's the thing. None of us can help our heights! Ladies (and, I guess men, too) can wear higher shoes, but they can only boost you so much. Even with all their money, celebrities can't change how tall or short they are. It's just nature! And like all of us, famous people just want to be loved for who they are, no matter what size their skeletons are.</p><p>In this list, I'll show you 15 celebrity couples with the&nbsp;biggest and most adorable height discrepancies. But don't think for a minute that there are just giant men and petite women on this list! I've got some famous dudes who literally look up to their female partners, too. Keep reading to learn more about my favorite famous couples who have major height differences!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-and-erin-darke>Daniel Radcliffe and Erin Darke</h2><p>Standing at just 5'5," Daniel Radcliffe hasn't grown much since his days playing boy wizard, Harry Potter. Despite not being exactly leading man height, the former child actor has made quite the name for himself in both films and theater. On the set of his 2013 movie,&nbsp;Kill Your Darlings, where Radcliffe played a young version of the beat writer, Allen Ginsberg, he met his current girlfriend, Erin Darke. At around 5'8," Erin stands tall above her rumored fiance, especially when she is wearing high-heeled shoes for an event.</p><p>We all know many details about Daniel Radcliffe, but who is his taller partner? Erin Darke is an actress who struggled to make it in show business. She told Moviefone that at age 21, she and her friend moved to New York City with no money and big dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You just have to fight. You just have to keep going," she said. Darke has appeared in the movie,&nbsp;Thank You For Your Service,&nbsp;alongside Miles Teller and in the Amazon Prime original series,&nbsp;Good Girls Revolt. Though it is often hard for celeb couples to stay together when they both work crazy schedules and go a long time without seeing each other, this pair seems solid. Darke says she finds support and respect in her actor boyfriend, while Radcliffe told Playboy that he loves his girl's sense of humor. This couple proves that it doesn't matter what you look like... true love is true love!</p><h2 id=nicole-kidman-and-keith-urban>Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban</h2><p>I don't know about you, but when I think about tall, statuesque ladies, I think of Nicole Kidman. This gorgeous, blonde Australian looks like she could be a model! At 5'11," she is already taller than most people, but when she puts on heels for the red carpet, she towers over everyone! That includes her husband, the country star and fellow Aussie, Keith Urban. The singer is a pretty normal height at 5'9" but looks much shorter than his spouse when she is wearing tall shoes for an event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But take one look at this couple and you can see that they could be tall or short, fat or thin, and it wouldn't matter. They are so adorable in love and always showing public displays of affection! In fact, this duo has stood the test of time, especially for a celebrity couple. The two got married in 2006 after just a year of dating and have two daughters together. Perhaps they can accredit their successful marriage to their individual career successes.</p><p>Because she is so tall for a woman, Keith is not the first partner Nicole has had that was shorter than her. Back in the '90s, she was married to Tom Cruise, who is known for being short for a guy and for dating taller ladies. At 5'7," Cruise was noticeably shorter than his lady love. This didn't seem to bother the pair at the time, but apparently, after their breakup, Nicole said: "Now I can wear heels." Ouch!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-kate-olsen-and-olivier-sarkozy>Mary-Kate Olsen and Olivier Sarkozy</h2><p>Mary-Kate Olsen, one-half of the famous Olsen twins, has tried her hardest to separate herself from her childhood stardom. After phasing out her acting career, she and twin, Ashley, developed their fashion line, Elizabeth & James. The super petite businesswoman stands just 5' 2," which would make almost any partner tower over her.</p><p>Her husband, the French billionaire, Olivier Sarkozy, is a whopping 6' 3," giving him over a foot of height on his spouse. Though the pair is super wealthy (I mean, he is the brother of the former French president!) their wedding was pretty low-key. These two keep the details of their relationship pretty private, but that doesn't stop them from engaging in major PDA. Something about their size difference makes their cuddles and kisses so much cuter!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But their 13-inch height discrepancy isn't the only major gap in this duo's life. Sarkozy is 17 years older than Olsen, which led to a huge frenzy of skepticism in the media when they first stepped out as a couple back in 2012. However, these two have proved everyone wrong and have been happily married since 2015. Olsen revealed in an interview with The Edit that, despite being a former child star and now a fashion designer, her home life is like everyone else's. "I have a husband, two stepkids, and a life; I have to go home and cook dinner," she said. Marriage looks the same whether you're rich or poor, short or tall, young or old, it seems!</p><h2 id=hayden-panettiere-and-wladimir-klitschko>Hayden Panettiere and Wladimir Klitschko</h2><p>If you want to see a celebrity couple with an adorably hilarious height difference, look no further than Hayden Panettiere and Wladimir Klitschko. With Hayden standing just 5'2" and her fiance at a whopping 6'6," they can hardly even fit in the same photo together! Even though she wears super high heels whenever they walk the red carpet together, the Nashville star is still nowhere close to her man's height. To be fair, at&nbsp;six and a half feet tall, Wladimir would be taller than pretty much everyone! Pro athletes are always enormous, and this Ukranian former boxer had to be huge in order to defeat his enemies, and it definitely worked! He is a two-time world heavyweight champion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they look adorable together now, this couple hasn't always had it so easy. After dating for awhile, they split up in 2011. However, they saw the light and got back together and are now engaged with a little girl. It is hard to imagine such a giant guy like Wladimir being gentle and kind around his tiny partner and tinier daughter, but he does it somehow. This duo seems like such an unlikely couple all around. They are so different in size, they grew up in different countries, one is an actor and one is an athlete, and they both have to travel a lot for their work. Somehow, though, they put all of these differences aside and have a happy relationship including fun outings with their baby, Kaya.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-momoa-and-lisa-bonet>Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet</h2><p>If you don't have a crush on Lisa Bonet, Jason Momoa, or both of them, you are just wrong. This celebrity couple is so good looking and talented as a duo and individually, it's crazy! Though many of us were first exposed to Lisa when she played Denise Huxtable on The Cosby Show, the actress has continued to work on films and television shows since the sitcom ended. While Jason did not grow up a child star, he has had his share of fame and success in the past two decades. Because of his large physique, the actor is best known for playing strong characters, including Khal Drogo on Game of Thrones and the title character in Conan the Barbarian. Despite their very different careers, these two somehow run in the same circle and met through mutual friends. Such a fairy tale!</p><p>Apparently, the two actors experienced love at first sight, though Jason admits that he had a crush on Lisa way back in her sitcom days. These two have been happily married for over a decade, which is an eternity in celebrity years. They have two kids together but Jason also acts as the perfect stepdad to Lisa's daughter, Zoe. He even gets along with her ex, Lenny Kravitz! This duo is pretty much the definition of relationship goals. The one weird thing about their marriage is their enormous height difference. Lisa is a petite 5'2," while her hubby stands tall at 6'4." That's a 14-inch&nbsp;height difference!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-hart-and-eniko-parrish>Kevin Hart and Eniko Parrish</h2><p>Kevin Hart is honestly everywhere these days. There is hardly a time you can go to the movie theater and not see either one of his films playing or a trailer for an upcoming movie he's starring in. The funny man seemed to have burst onto the Hollywood scene just a few years ago, but his crazy work ethic made him a household name. From his hilarious stand-up comedy to hosting gigs to comedy movies of all types, Kevin seems to be constantly on the go.</p><p>That makes it hard to believe that he even has time for a partner, but this comedian and actor is actually married! His wife, Eniko Parrish, is a model but definitely is nowhere near as famous as her celebrity husband. Her line of work definitely makes sense considering this gorgeous lady stands 5'7," a full three inches taller than her 5'4" hubby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While just a few inches of height difference doesn't seem like much, when you consider her statuesque figure and her high-heeled shoes, Eniko often appears much taller than Kevin. Most shorter guys would be thrilled to partner up with a beautiful, tall lady, but Kevin clearly took his wife for granted. Late in 2017, the comedian addressed infidelity rumors and admitted that he had, in fact, had an affair while his partner was pregnant with their first baby together, son Kenzo. At least he took responsibility for his actions and said that being unfaithful to his spouse was his "dumbest moment."</p><h2 id=liam-hemsworth-and-miley-cyrus>Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus</h2><p>Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus are one of the most notoriously on-again, off-again celebrity couples of our time. This duo has been together officially since 2010 but has had tons of relationship drama since then. When they met on the set of the romantic drama,&nbsp;The Last Song,&nbsp;in 2009, the two lovebirds felt an instant bond but being young and busy with work, they suffered many breakups along the way. The couple got engaged in 2012, broke it off in 2013, got back together unofficially in 2016, and got re-engaged the same year. Whew!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The twerking singer and hunky actor seem like a weird pair when you consider their nationalities, busy schedules, and lines of work, but they seem made for each other. Even during the times when they were broken up, the pair apparently continued to keep in contact.</p><p>Miley even said of their 2013 split, "I think people that break up and get back together, that’s awesome. You get time to be yourself. You get time to grow up." These two were clearly meant to be; they just needed time to find themselves since they were so young when they met. One of the cutest aspects of this celeb couple's relationship is their height difference. Despite her big personality, Miley is a modest 5'5," while her hubby-to-be towers over her at 6'3." This makes all of their photos, from red carpet poses to snuggly Instagram snaps, extra adorable. It's no wonder that Liam refers to Miley as his "little angel!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-michelle-gellar-and-freddie-prinze-jr>Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.</h2><p>Looking for the perfect couple to model your relationship goals after? Look no further than '90s teen dream couple, Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar. These two gained their fame individually as crushworthy teen idols&nbsp;two decades ago. The pair met in 1997 while filming the thriller,&nbsp;I Know What You Did Last Summer,&nbsp;and became friends. A few years later, they decided to go on a proper date and the rest is history. The two actors went on to star in other films together including the Scooby-Doo films and providing voices for the Star Wars Rebels animated series.</p><p>Since marrying in 2002, this celeb couple has held strong, raising two kids together, bonding over their love of food, and gushing over each other on Instagram. Though this duo is pretty private about their personal lives, it is no secret how in love they are, even after 15 years of marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These two look just as in love as they were in the early '00s and it's like a fairytale come true! Sarah even took Freddie's last name when they got married, though she still uses Gellar as her stage name. In addition to the total heart-eyes looks that Freddie and Sarah give each other, another thing that makes them so cute is their huge height discrepancy. Freddie stands tall at 6'1," while his wife is a tiny 5'2." The way he looks lovingly down at her and the way she gazes adoringly up at him is so precious!</p><h2 id=peter-dinklage-and-erica-schmidt>Peter Dinklage and Erica Schmidt</h2><p>I know, I know. This entry is sort of a throw-away for this list. Peter Dinklage, as we all know, was born with a form of dwarfism, which caused him to top out at 4'5" as an adult. However, this hasn't stopped him from being handsome, charming, and a major Hollywood star. The actor may be best known for portraying Tyrion Lannister on HBO's,&nbsp;Game of Thrones, but he has also appeared in a number of films, including X-Men: Days of Future Past and The Station Agent. Peter has been nominated for many awards and has won a Golden Globe Award and two Primetime Emmy Awards. So, despite his short stature, this actor has a lot to offer!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, size was no factor when Peter's wife, Erica Schmidt, met him. Though she is over a foot taller than him at 5'6," the two have been married since 2005 and have two children together. Erica also works in show business, though she decided to focus on the theatre when she had trouble finding acting jobs.</p><p>She has directed many off-Broadway plays and even directed a production of Rent in Tokyo. Also a playwright, Erica is well-known in the New York theater community. In fact, Peter has called his wife, "brilliant," and "the artist of the family," saying that he just "pays the bills." The pair doesn't let their height difference bother them, nor do they respond to any haters. In fact, this celeb couple is one of the most private duos in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sacha-baron-cohen-and-isla-fisher>Sacha Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher</h2><p>You may not have heard the name Sacha Baron Cohen, but you have definitely heard of Ali G, Borat, or Bruno. These wacky characters are all the creations of the three-named British actor, who is known for his controversial antics. Though he is best-known for creating his own troupe of unique personalities, Sacha has also been cast in mainstream films.</p><p>A talented singer as well as an actor, he has appeared in the movie versions of the musicals,&nbsp;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and Les Miserables. Though he loves to act outrageous and be the center of attention, Sacha's personal life is pretty private. He married his wife, fellow actor, Isla Fisher, in a tiny, intimate ceremony after dating for 14 years. The pair has three kids together.</p><p>Isla is pretty much the opposite of her hubby. At 5'3," she is a full foot shorter than her tall, goofy partner. She always looks classy and acts very demure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Australian-born actress has taken jobs that no one would bat an eye at, including silly comedies and sweet rom-coms. You may have seen this red-haired beauty in Wedding Crashers, Confessions of a Shopaholic, and Definitely, Maybe. She was described by Time Out magazine as "silly and adorable;" this is a far cry from the often nasty reviews that her husband gets for his work. No matter how different they look and act and how different their work is, these two lovebirds are clearly in it for the long haul.</p><h2 id=will-smith-and-jada-pinkett-smith>Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith</h2><p>It seems like rumors are always swirling around Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith's marriage. The two have been together since the '90s, marrying in 1997. When you have been together that long, the media is bound to create fake stories just to rile you up and attract readers! These two have been accused of being swingers and practicing Scientology and divorce rumors have hounded them for years. However, Will recently addressed tabloid stories of his split from Jada in his new song, "To The Clique."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Stop the divorce rumors and mind your&nbsp;[...] business!" he pleads. This celeb couple has somehow made it work for two decades despite their crazy schedules. When they first got together, Will was at the height of his fame, producing TV series, films, and albums one after the other. Jada, too, has kept a steady acting career for herself, meaning that they don't always get to spend time together.</p><p>Whether they are breaking up or not, this sweet couple clearly has each others' backs. They always look so cute on the red carpet together because Will is 14 inches taller than Jada, towering at a whopping 6'2"! You would never think that he is that much bigger, though, because of how much love and respect is in his eyes whenever he looks at her. He has even said, "I honestly believe there is no woman for me but Jada." Jada has responded by saying she would rather give up her career than get divorced. Aww!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-diaz-and-benji-madden>Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden</h2><p>Remember when Cameron Diaz was everywhere? From action movies to romcoms to family films, the actress seemed to be in everything in the '00s. When she wasn't on screen, you could bet on seeing her in tabloids, spotted with one of her famous beaus like Justin Timberlake or Alex Rodriguez. However, since marrying Good Charlotte guitarist, Benji Madden, in 2015, she has taken a step back from the limelight. Cameron's last acting role was in 2014's remake of Annie, and sources say that she is enjoying a quieter, more private life with her hubby. In fact, the two want to start a family! Though they seem like an odd pair, this celeb couple is the perfect match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You would never guess that Cameron and Benji would be together. One is a rock star, one is an actress. One is a blonde bombshell, one is covered in tattoos. Plus, Cameron is a full&nbsp;three inches taller than her partner, and that's without high-heeled shoes! However, the two can't gush enough about each other. Cameron told The Daily Mail that she and her hubby are "just weird enough for each other" and appreciates that he doesn't treat her like an object, but like "an equal." Benji, too, has only good things to say about his wife. He posted a sweet message on Instagram for her 45th birthday, saying "I feel like I am the LUCKIEST guy ALIVE" and "you got me til the end baby."</p><h2 id=kristen-bell-and-dax-shepard>Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard</h2><p>I don't know about you, but my all-time favorite celebrity couple is Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard. These two are just the absolute perfect fit. They goof around with each other, share posts about each other that are equal parts sweet and relatable, and keep their personal lives pretty private. They never share photos of their daughters. Plus, they are such different heights!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kristen is super tiny, standing at just 5'1," while her hubby is over a foot taller than her at 6'2"! Even though this pair is pretty famous, they act just like regular people. They share cute PDA on the red carpet, obsess over watching popular TV shows together, and are never afraid to share the funny ups and downs they experience each day as parents.</p><p>Dax is known for his goofy, sometimes, raunchy comedies, while Kristen is known for her good girl persona both off-screen and in roles on Veronica Mars and The Good Place. This duo started dating in 2007 and got married in 2013, giving birth to two children as well. Their wedding was inexpensive and actually took place at the County Clerk's Office. No huge celeb wedding here!</p><p>Instead of wearing a ring, Dax got a tattoo of a bell on his finger. Get it? Bell? They also waited to get married until gay marriage was legal in the state of California. What amazing people! Is it weird to have a crush on them as a couple?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shaquille-o-neal-and-laticia-rolle>Shaquille O'Neal and Laticia Rolle</h2><p>Everyone who was alive in the '90s knows who Shaquille O'Neal, aka Shaq, is. He was one of the most famous basketball players ever and is also an actor and sports analyst. But even more, he is known for his talent, this athlete is remembered for being an actual giant. At 7'1," he looms over pretty much everyone he meets. That is why it's so funny that his longtime girlfriend, Laticia Rolle, is just 5'6," a modest height by anyone's standards. But who is this gorgeous lady who barely comes up to Shaq's armpit when they pose together? Laticia is a lifestyle blogger who founded the site BluHazl. She is also an entrepreneur. Laticia founded TRESS, a company that creates baseball hats designed for women with curly, textured, or just big hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Shaq made more than enough money off his NBA career to keep any spouse from ever having to work, Laticia isn't a kept woman by any means. She's super hardworking and is a successful businesswoman in her own right! These two always look so happy and in love when they are together, but unfortunately, there is no talk of wedding bells yet. Despite the fact that Laticia is sporting a huge ring on "that finger" and has talked about starting a family with her man, the pair claims that they are not officially engaged yet. That gives her lots of time to find some super high heels to wear on their wedding day!</p><h2 id=mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher>Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher</h2><p>One of the cutest Hollywood love stories is that of Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher. They first met on the set of That '70s Show 20 years ago and their characters dated on the show, but in real life, they didn't get together until much later. The pair has been married for over&nbsp;two years and have two kids together. Though the couple kept in touch as friends after the show ended in the mid-'00s, they didn't always see each other in a romantic light. However, Mila shared with Elle that one day she saw him from behind at an awards show and when he turned around "it was like . . . we were in a movie" and that "for the first time ever he took [her] breath away." Even after they finally realized they liked each other, their relationship wasn't well-defined. Apparently, the two lovebirds were just friends with benefits at first!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when Ashton and Mila realized that they both wanted more out of their relationship, the rest&nbsp;was history. Who would have thought that Jackie and Kelso would end up getting married in real life?! When this hilarious and attractive couple met, Mila was just 14 and Ashton was 20. In addition to their age gap, the actors also have a huge height gap between them. Ashton is pretty darn tall at 6'2," while petite Mila is just 5'4." This makes it extra cute when they are posing on the red carpet or snuggling at a sports game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLAtr7Pq6CsoZ6ceqSxy56ZZpufqr2tsdJmrqKsmGKxqsbZsqCnn12dsqqzx61knaGWm7Kzsc2cnKxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./20-images-of-adrienne-bailon-s-transformation-from-cheetah-girls-to-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Images Of Adrienne Bailon's Transformation From Cheetah Girls To Now">&larr;
