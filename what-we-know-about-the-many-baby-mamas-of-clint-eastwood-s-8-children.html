For example, Elizabeth Taylor was married 8 times, Larry King also tied the knot 8 times, Martin Scorsese has walked down the aisle 5 times, and Rita Hayworth got divorced 5 times as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While all of those aforementioned stars got married many, many times during their lives, some celebrities chose to get involved with many partners without getting married regularly. A perfect example of that kind of star, Clint Eastwood has married two women but it is known that he had many more partners than that.</p><p>One of the most intensely private celebrities in a lot of ways, Clint Eastwood often does his very best to avoid talking to the media about his private life. However, it is known that he has at least 8 children, some of whom his wives gave birth to and others were born out of wedlock. Of course, other stars like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mick Jagger also have loads of kids</a> but it is still remarkable so it begs the question, who are the women that Clint Eastwood has children with.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Eddie Murphy’s Ex Baby Mama, Paulette Mcneely?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hollywood-legend>Hollywood Legend</h2><p>If the movie industry had an official Hall of Fame, it seems pretty obvious that Clint Eastwood would be among the first people to be inducted. After all, the man not only is an actor and director, but he has excelled in both of those roles over the years.</p><p>Still best known as an actor to this day, Clint Eastwood has headlined so many classic movies that it seems like he has the Midas touch. Arguably the most important western film star to ever live, Eastwood’s roles in films like the Man with No Name trilogy, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and Unforgiven are enough to make him a legend. On top of those roles, you can’t talk about Eastwood’s career without bringing up movies like Dirty Harry, In the Line of Fire, and Million Dollar Baby among many others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seemingly not content with being a legendary actor alone, Clint Eastwood also has one of the most celebrated film directing careers of all-time. After all, Eastwood won a pair of Best Director Oscars due to his work helming Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby. Also nominated for Academy Awards due to his work directing Mystic River and Letter from Iwo Jima, according to IMDb, Clint has directed 41 different films.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">12 Surprising Facts About Drake’s Baby Mama, Sophie Brussaux</a></span></p><h2 id=children-from-clint-s-marriages>Children From Clint’s Marriages</h2><p>When it comes to the personal lives of celebrities, it could be argued that Clint Eastwood’s is the most fascinating of all. After all, the world knows that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clint Eastwood has at least 8 children, most of which he had with different women</a>. That is the case because Clint refuses to make it clear if he has any other children, so it is entirely possible he has more kids out there, possibly with other mothers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Married for the first time in 1953, Clint Eastwood’s wife Maggie Johnson stayed with him until their 1984 divorce. During their 30-year marriage, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which is far from a record for Hollywood</a>, Eastwood and Johnson had two children together, their son Kyle who was born in 1968 and their daughter Maggie who was born in 1972. Both entertainers in their own right Kyle is a jazz bassist while Maggie has been a fairly successful actor.</p><p>Married for the second time in 1996, Clint Eastwood and his other wife Dina Ruiz stayed together for a long time as well considering they got divorced in 2014. During their 18 years of marriage, Eastwood and Ruiz had one kid together, their daughter Morgan who was born in 1996. The youngest of Clint’s known children, Morgan used to appear on the “reality” show, Mrs. Eastwood & Company alongside her mom and one of her step-sisters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Eddie Murphy And His Multiple Baby Mamas</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clint-s-children-born-out-of-wedlock>Clint’s Children Born Out Of Wedlock</h2><p>The eldest of Clint Eastwood’s known children, Laurie was born in 1953 when her father was still dating his first wife, Maggie Johnson. Given up for adoption at that time, it took Laurie 30 years to learn who her father is and track him down. To this day, the general public doesn’t know the identity of Laurie’s biological mother but it is known that her adoptive mom is Seattle’s Helen Warren.</p><p>Clint Eastwood’s second child, Kimber Eastwood was born in 1964 and was the result of an affair he had with the stuntwoman and dancer Roxanne Tunis. Kept a secret for many years, Kimber’s existence was revealed to the public in 1989 and since then she has become a make-up artist and film producer.</p><p>During Clint Eastwood’s divorce from his first wife and his live-in partnership with Sondra Locke, he engaged in yet another affair, this time with a flight attendant named Jacelyn Reeves. Far from a fling, Eastwood and Reeves had 2 children during their time together, their son Scott who was born in 1986 and their daughter Kathryn who entered the world in 1988. While Kathryn and Scott are both actors, her career has yet to take off. On the other hand, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott has become successful enough as an actor that it could be argued that he is destined to follow in Clint Eastwood's footsteps</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, Clint Eastwood’s second youngest child, Francesca, was born in 1993 and it is known that he was present for her birth, which isn’t the case with his other kids. Also featured in the short-lived “reality” show Mrs. Eastwood & Company, Francesca’s mother is the extremely respected actor Frances Fisher.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About All Of Lil Wayne’s Baby Mamas</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMrZ%2BeZZ2Wu7p5wZqZsmWdlrqiv4yonWabnJ67tXnEmqqtr5%2BksbR5l2aaoaGcmb%2Bmuo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wilmer-valderrama-welcomes-1st-child-with-amanda-pacheco.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wilmer Valderrama Welcomes 1st Child With Amanda Pacheco">&larr;
