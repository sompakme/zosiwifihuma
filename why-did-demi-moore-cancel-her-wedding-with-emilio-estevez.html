The actress has been married three times in her life, and each one of those ended in divorce. Her first husband was rock power pop singer Freddy Moore, to whom she was married for about four years between 1981 and 1985.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That particular relationship was seemingly doomed from the start, as she would later admit that she <a href=#>only got married to him to distract herself</a> from the death of her father. She was unfaithful from the beginning, and that was only going to end one way.</p><p>Moore later got into more stable marriages, first to Bruce Willis and then later to Ashton Kutcher. Despite the fact that both of those did not work either, there is at least a lot more amiability between her and the two actors. She is especially <a href=#>affectionate to Willis’ current wife</a>, Emma Heming Willis.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Demi Moore And Bruce Willis Cheat On Each Other During Their Marriage?</a></span></p><p>Before her affair with the Die Hard star, though, Moore almost walked down the aisle again. Soon after her split from Freddy Moore, she got engaged to actor Emilio Estévez, but she called off the wedding at the last minute.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-demi-moore-and-emilio-est-eacute-vez-meet>How Did Demi Moore And Emilio Estévez Meet?</h2><p>Emilio Estévez became famous in the 1980s for being one of the founding members of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">acting group known as the Brat Pack</a>. Alongside other then young stars like Rob Lowe and Anthony Michael Hall, the group comprised various actors who often appeared together in teenage films during that period.</p><p>The Brat Pack was known best for the movies The Breakfast Club and St. Elmo’s Fire, which were both released in 1985. Estévez met Demi Moore for the first time during the auditions for the latter, and she would even go on to be inducted into the acting group herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More than three decades later, Moore would do an interview with Vanity Fair, in which she described Estévez as the first man she truly loved. She also revealed that there was an instant connection between them. They started dating and within no time, they were already engaged and planning for their wedding.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Way Demi Moore Landed Her Star-Making Role In St. Elmo's Fire, According To The Film's Co-Writer</a></span></p><p>Moore and Estévez’s relationship lasted nearly three years, but was unable to go the distance, as the Repo Man actor was reportedly left devastated.</p><h2 id=why-did-demi-moore-cancel-her-wedding-to-emilio-est-eacute-vez>Why Did Demi Moore Cancel Her Wedding To Emilio Estévez?</h2><p>Considering the complicated nature of her first marriage – and the fact that there was barely any time between that relationship and the one with Emilio Estévez – Demi Moore might have been a bit too quick in planning another wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her interview with Vanity Fair</a>, she explained the reasons why she felt that she couldn’t go through with getting married to Estévez, after all. “Emilio and I were at two different junctures in our internal lives,” she said. “Emilio’s focus was more work-oriented. There were certain things that he, at his age, wasn’t interested in.”</p><p>She explained that although she left him just before they got to the altar, it was not a signal that she did not love him. In fact, she wanted to emphasize just the opposite.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Demi Moore Reveals Who Her 'Women Crush Wednesday' Is In Her Recent Instagram Post</a></span></p><p>“Ending it was not saying ‘You’re a real a**hole, that’s why I’m leaving.’ It was ‘Wow, I really love you so much, but it’s not right, is it?” Moore continued. “It was the most mature step I could’ve made. But I couldn’t love him and be that close anymore.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=demi-moore-remained-close-to-emilio-est-eacute-vez-rsquo-s-family-after-their-breakup>Demi Moore Remained Close To Emilio Estévez’s Family After Their Breakup</h2><p>Emilio Estévez hails from <a href=#>a Hollywood royalty family</a>. He is the son of West Wing and Grace and Frankie star Martin Sheen (born Ramón Estévez). He is the oldest of four siblings: Ramón Luis Estévez, Charlie Sheen and Renée Estévez, all of whom have enjoyed careers in the film and television industry.</p><p>While Emilio was seeing Demi Moore, his brother Charlie Sheen’s girlfriend was Dolly Fox. The actress grew a very close relationship with Moore as a result, who was in fact her support system when she also broke up with Sheen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Since we were dating brothers, we became like sisters… When I broke up with Charlie, Demi was a backbone for me,” Fox said. “Demi is a great girlfriend. I admire her more than anybody. She’s always evolving as a human, an actor, a woman, a spirit.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Moore herself retained a close connection with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Estévez/Sheen family</a>, who helped to ease her into the cut-throat world of showbiz. “It definitely gave me a safe place to view [the industry] from,” she recalled. “I had their experience to protect me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecOepKJlnaS8s7GMnJinm5Wheqmx0WaunpyUnruoedaiq6FllaK2rbXOZpysrJWrsrt7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-leann-rimes-is-us-weekly-s-woman-crush.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why LeAnn Rimes Is Us Weeklys Woman Crush">&larr;
