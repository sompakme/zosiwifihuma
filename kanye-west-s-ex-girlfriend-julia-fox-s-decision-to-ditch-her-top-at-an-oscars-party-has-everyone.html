While her relationship with the rapper was short-lived, her looks continued to get her attention. She's found her on several lists detailing her outfit choices, from daring to inspiring, including Vogue's "Everything Julia Fox teaches us about dressing for the female gaze."

"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I wanted to look a certain way where the girls would appreciate it</a>, and the men would despise it." Her changing body and different approach to clothing and makeup got attention, but not all of it was positive. "And men started reacting like: 'Wait, what happened to her? She used to be so hot.' And I leaned into it. I was, like, Oh, great, they hate me – and I love it.

This gave fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a front-row seat to their coupling with photos posted on Instagram and interviews</a>. "I mean, I'm still in shock," Fox told Interview in January 2022. "Ye had an entire hotel suite full of clothes. It was every girl's dream come true. It felt like a real Cinderella moment," she said at the time. "I don't know how he did it or how he got all of it there in time. But I was so surprised."

Still, their relationship was over just as quickly as it began.
