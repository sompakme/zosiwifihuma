Growing up in the Koreatown area, he discovered his talent for drawing at a young age. Inspired by graffiti artists Hex and Mear One, Choe delved into the world of graffiti in 1990, experimenting with bold colors and intricate designs.</p><p>“Graffiti taught me how to deal with fear, how to be courageous, how to feel free, how to get up after you fall, and how to live in the present moment.”</p><p>Choe’s art career took an unexpected turn when his parents’ real estate business was burned down during the Los Angeles riots. This event led him to drop out of high school and embark on a two-year hitchhiking journey across America, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. These travels exposed him to diverse cultures and experiences, shaping his artistic perspective.</p><p>Although he briefly attended the California College of the Arts, Choe decided to pursue his art career independently.
