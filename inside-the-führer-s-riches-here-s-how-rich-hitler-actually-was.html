The controversial political figure was known for his unconventional ruling tactics, which involved the ill-treatment of jews as well as the <a href=#>initiation of World War II</a> that saw the invasion of Poland in 1939. Hitler's unorthodox ruling style involved the usage of several unlawful practices that benefited the German dictator's personal net worth, with his empire valued at a whopping $5 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adolf Hitler exploited his position and even his future posting as chancellor of the German government in many ways to procure state funds and even avoid income tax duties for his own gain. The feared German dictator also used his political preference to propagate the sales of his book, with the combined monetary benefits procured through the usage of his deceitful methods catapulting his net worth.</p><h2 id=rising-from-a-troubled-childhood>Rising From A Troubled Childhood</h2><p>Adolf Hitler's poverty-stricken upbringing was a prominent factor in <a href=#>his quest of building an enormous fortune</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A young and directionless Adolf would struggle to find his calling in life, with his dismal academic career and poor health proving to be contributing factors to his violent outlook on life. Hitler's father often encouraged his son to make something of himself, but the constant nagging from his family combined with his lack of focus only fueled his hate-filled personality that much more.</p><p>The future dictator was determined to amass a great fortune that would give him a lavish lifestyle, with this unrelenting quest directing him to a path of trickery and deception.</p><p>Hitler's steady stream of income as a politician was derived through a variety of unjust practices undertaken throughout his stint as <a href=#>the leader of the Nazi party</a>. The German dictator was known to be a cunning strategist, with his rapacious mindset targeting the wealth of several corporations, businessmen, and even his own government.</p><p>RELATED:</p><h2 id=taking-a-devious-course-of-action>Taking A Devious Course Of Action</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hitler's obsession with money was profound</a>, with the German dictator coming up with several creative ideas to boost his personal fortune that much more.

However, by undertaking the position of chancellor, Hitler ordered his government to purchase copies of his very own book titled 'Mein Kampf' to be given as state wedding gifts to newlyweds.</p><p>This ingenious methodology earned the Fuhrer hefty royalties from book sales. Additionally, Hitler steered clear of paying any form of income tax throughout his political career, leading to an undisclosed monetary benefit that skyrocketed his personal net worth to the billions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Ruthless Tyrants Worse Than Hitler</a></span></p><h2 id=a-peek-inside-hitler-s-extravagant-lifestyle>A Peek Inside Hitler's Extravagant Lifestyle</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adolf Hitler considered himself to be a man with superior intellect. The German dictator's tactical approach added to his net worth immensely, with his powerful political presence leading to the accumulation of lavish gifts and the loyalty of several other notable politicians and business professionals.</p><p>Hitler was notorious for exploiting his political presence for his own monetary gain. The German dictator used his inequitable fortune to procure several priceless art relics, fine furnishings, and even expensive properties that made his unjust business ethics stark.</p><p>The German dictator's earnings from corrupt political agendas, book sales, and his refusal to pay his share of income tax translated to <a href=#>an enormous personal net worth</a>. With an estimated $5 billion in funds, Adolf Hitler was easily one of the wealthiest political figures of his time and perhaps in the entire history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-liquidation-of-hitler-s-empire>The Liquidation Of Hitler's Empire</h2><p>With the death of Hitler in 1945, the Nazi leader's property and monetary assets, which included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a house in Munich</a>, were relinquished to the state of Bavaria by the Allied Control Commission.</p><p>The meteoric escalation of Hitler's personal net worth was down to his unjust practices as well as a gross abuse of power, with <a href=#>his $5 billion empire</a> consisting of state funds, income tax duties as well as the royalties earned through the sales of his book that was made possible due to his position as chancellor of his government.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adolf Hitler's controversial stint as the Nazi party leader made him one of the most feared and hate-inspiring political figures globally. Hitler's corrupt approach proved fatal for the people of Germany, with his illegal methodology directed towards personal monetary gain wreaking havoc on the German government. The German dictator's enormous $5 billion empire was the epicenter of unjust and unlawful practices, with the likes of tax exemption as well as the usage of state funds hindering the growth and prosperity of the people of Germany.</p><p>The downfall of Hitler in 1945 would unravel the immense monetary gain incurred by the German dictator during his stint as the Nazi party leader, with a variety of his items including arts relics, properties, and cars sporting exorbitant price tags at auction in recent times. Adolf Hitler's quest to make an enormous fortune was undeniably realized, but at the cost of many people's livelihood along with the helping hand of delinquency.</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p><span class=next-single style=font-weight:400>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Dictators And Their Extravagant Lifestyles</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS2r7%2FInZxmrJiaeqfBx6ucq6tdp7aktMSsZKGdoprAbrTOsGSroZOdeqm106Wcq2WRmMG2rculsGavkah8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ivan-semwanga-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ivan Semwangas biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story">&larr;
