She was a positive force in the world, a tireless and unapologetic champion for women, and passionate about her work as a therapist. I am overcome with grief. I would like to thank you in advance for giving myself and everyone who loved Amie privacy while we try to work through this tragic situation.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harwick, a therapist, was found unresponsive and "gravely injured" beneath a third-story balcony at her home early Saturday morning, according to a statement from the Los Angeles Police Department. The LAPD responded to a call of a "woman screaming" in the Hollywood Hills at around 1:16 a.m. that day. Harwick's roommate met the officers outside once they arrived and told them Harwick was assaulted inside of the residence. According to the LAPD's press release, the roommate jumped over a wall and gone to a neighbors residence to call for help.</p><p>Police said the investigation revealed possible evidence of a struggle. There were also signs of forced entry into the residence. Following further canvassing around the area, there was also evidence of an intruder entering and leaving the property.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harwick's former boyfriend, Gareth Pursehouse, 41, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of the murder. According to jail records, Pursehouse is being held on a $2 million bail. According to the LAPD's press release, detectives learned Harwick expressed fear of an ex-boyfriend and had previously filed a restraining order against him. Per the release, the restraining order&nbsp;had expired and Harwick had seen her ex-boyfriend two weeks ago.</p><p>The&nbsp;investigation is still ongoing and will be presented to the District Attorney for filing consideration on Wednesday.</p><p>Harwick was a well-known therapist in West Hollywood where she specialized in family and sex counseling. She frequently appeared in podcasts, TV, and Youtube channels to discuss her work.</p><p>Carey, 61, was engaged to Harwick in 2018, but the duo broke up less than a year later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Amie and I had a love that people are lucky to have once in a lifetime,” Carey said in a statement to <a href=#>People Magazine</a>. “She was a positive force in the world, a tireless and unapologetic champion for women, and passionate about her work as a therapist.
