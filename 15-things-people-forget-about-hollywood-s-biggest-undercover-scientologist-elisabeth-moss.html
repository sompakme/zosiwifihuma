That’s because she is one actress that has successfully managed to make a transition from one highly-rated television drama to another. And you can’t say that about everyone. Elisabeth enjoyed critical acclaim for her role as Peggy on Mad Men to June on the very popular Hulu series, The Handmaid Tale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And even though Elisabeth Moss is making headlines for all of her great roles, there is very little that her fans actually know about her. That’s because Elisabeth is one actress that likes to keep her private life very private. There’s very little that she will say about what goes on behind closed doors. In addition, there is very little that she will publicly say about her infamous religion, Scientology. Even though she’s been a member all her life, she refuses to talk about it.</p><p>That’s why so many people are so interested in Elisabeth Moss. After all, she’s not like the other Hollywood stars out there. With that being said, here are 15 things you probably didn’t know about Elisabeth Moss.</p><h2 id=she-s-super-private><strong>She’s Super Private</strong></h2><p>Elisabeth Moss doesn’t like to talk about her boyfriends, her love life, or anything that happens to her personally, for that matter. That’s because she got burned emotionally during her last marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Even though she’s been rumored to have dated guys like Adam Arkapaw and Tom Hiddleston, you’ll never hear Elisabeth talk about it. What’s more, you’ll never see her out and about with any of her love interests, either.</strong></p><p>According to Elite Daily, Elisabeth had this to say about her future marriage and family plans: “I want it all ... fast. I want to be married, I want to live together ... and then somewhere around a year or two years, I get freaked out. I freak out emotionally and then I actually feel like 'Oh my God, who's this stranger in my house?'”</p><h2 id=you-will-never-hear-her-talking-about-scientology><strong>You Will Never Hear Her Talking About Scientology</strong></h2><p>Elisabeth Moss has been a Scientologist all of her life, but she’s not like Tom Cruise or Leah Remini. She’s not a poster girl for the controversial religion. As a matter of fact, a lot of her Mad Men fans were pretty shocked to find out that she’s been a closeted Scientologist all of these years. It’s been noted that the religion has helped shape her into the successful Hollywood star that she is today. But she hasn’t made a peep about it and from the looks of it, she won’t say anything about it in the future, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Cosmopolitan, “Moss was raised as a Scientologist in Los Angeles; unlike other celebrities who joined the Church as adults, she grew up in the organization and its belief system helped form who she is.”</p><h2 id=but-she-does-defend-it><strong>But She Does Defend&nbsp;It</strong></h2><p>Even though Elisabeth rarely talks about her religion, she will defend it when she needs too. When an Instagram follower compared Scientology to Gilead, the fundamentalist cult that her character is involved in The Handmaid Tale, Elisabeth fired back.</p><p>“Both Gilead and Scientology both believe that all outside sources (aka news) are wrong or evil. It’s just very interesting,” a user named <a href=#>@moelybanks</a> wrote.</p><p>According to USA Today, she wrote back to her Instagram hater by saying this: “That’s actually not true at all about Scientology. Religious freedom and tolerance and understanding the truth and equal rights for every race, religion and creed are extremely important to me. The most important things to me probably. And so Gilead and (The Handmaid's Tale) hit me on a very personal level. Thanks for the interesting question!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-had-a-rocky-marriage-to-fred-armisen><strong>She Had a Rocky Marriage To Fred Armisen</strong></h2><p>It’s safe to say that Elisabeth’s marriage to her ex-husband, Fred Armisen, was a nightmare. And she has actually admitted that on paper, too.</p><p><strong>Things were so bad between them that Elisabeth once said that Fred’s best role is that of a “normal person.” Talk about a burn, especially coming from your ex-wife.</strong></p><p>According to People magazine, Elisabeth had this to say about her marriage: “Looking back, I feel like I was really young, and at the time I didn't think that I was that young. It was extremely traumatic and awful and horrible. At the same time, it turned out for the best. I'm glad that I'm not there. I'm glad that it didn't happen when I was 50. I'm glad I didn't have kids. And I got that out of the way. Hopefully. Like, that's probably not going to happen again.”</p><h2 id=she-never-talks-about-her-family><strong>She Never Talks About Her Family</strong></h2><p>Another strange thing about Elisabeth Moss is that she refuses to talk about her family. A lot of people think it’s because they are all Scientologists.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Unlike a lot of stars out there, she was actually born into Scientology, thanks to her family. Both of her parents, Ron and Lisa Moss, were musicians. She also has a younger brother who she doesn’t talk about, either.</strong></p><p>The Huffington Post reports her as saying, “I don't feel I was ever a 'famous' child actor. I was just a working actor who happened to be a kid. I was never really in a hit show until I was a teenager with West Wing playing First Daughter Zoey Bartlet. In a way, that was my saving grace - not being a star on a hit show. It kept me working and kept me grounded.”</p><h2 id=she-was-supposed-to-be-a-dancer><strong>She Was Supposed To Be A Dancer</strong></h2><p>Believe it or not, Elisabeth Moss didn’t dream of achieving Hollywood stardom. Instead, she was supposed to be a dancer.</p><p><strong>She began studying ballet as a young girl and even traveled to New York City to study ballet at the prestigious School of American Ballet. But then one thing led to another, and she found herself in Hollywood instead. And it’s a decision that she doesn't regret.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Huffington Post, she said, “When you audition for things, there's pressure to go in there with a complete performance, and it's kind of unfair because, if you get it, you'll have rehearsal and talk about it, and you'll have plenty of time with the script. So, for me, I really do feel like an audition is a sketch of what you might do.”</p><h2 id=she-s-got-a-bad-girl-side-to-her><strong>She’s Got A Bad Girl Side To Her</strong></h2><p>Elisabeth Moss might look like the epitome of the Hollywood good girl from the outside, but within, she’s got a bad girl that she’s ready to unleash. She’s also got a potty mouth and she’s not afraid to use it. That’s because she’s actually been encouraged to use foul language all of her life, thanks to Scientology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Hollywood Reporter had this to say back in 2017: “Scientologists are urged to communicate with 'average people,' and to do so effectively you have to 'go down the tone scale.' So they all use [swear words] every time they talk. It’s fascinating. The quote-unquote philosophy behind it is you match the tone level in order to communicate on the same level of the people with whom you’re communicating. If you’re too 'high-tone,' people will not understand you."</p><h2 id=but-she-ll-never-get-a-tattoo><strong>But She’ll Never Get A Tattoo</strong></h2><p>And while Elisabeth likes to curse like a sailor, if there’s one thing she will never do— get a tattoo like a sailor! It’s something that she thinks about every day, but she just hasn’t mustered enough courage to do it. One can only wonder what’s holding her back! I mean, she is one of very few Hollywood actresses who love to take risks. And when she does take one, she ends up getting the kind of results that others can only hope for. But for some reason, she’s yet to put any ink on her body.</p><p>Hollywood’s most fearless woman even talked about it once during a magazine interview about her secrets.&nbsp;Elisabeth confessed to Us Weekly, “I don't have any tattoos. I think about getting one every day, but then I get scared.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-obsessed-with-television><strong>She’s Obsessed With Television</strong></h2><p>It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that one of the television world’s biggest fans just happens to be a big television star, too. In other words, she’s a binge watcher just like the rest of us.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth actually prefers to stay in and watch what’s on television than go to the movie theater. Yes, she’s just like us!</strong></p><p>Elisabeth also dives into all of the characters that she plays. She doesn’t hold anything back. According to Pop Sugar, Elisabeth once said, “If I'm not like my characters, I think just it's like a musician liking to play certain pieces of music rather than others. I just have more satisfaction when playing complicated things rather than some of your more straightforward, simple moments... I like to be challenged.”</p><h2 id=she-has-a-secret-love-for-disneyland><strong>She Has A Secret Love For Disneyland</strong></h2><p>Not only does Elisabeth have an obsession with showing the world her middle finger (just check out her Instagram account), but she also has a strong obsession with all things Disney-related. Several years ago she even got a photo banned on a ride that she was on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She had this to say on The Tonight Show:&nbsp;“We're like, 'Let's look tough.' ... So I decided a tough thing to do would be to do the middle finger to the camera. And then we got off the ride and we were looking for our photo and the photo wasn't up there. We're like, 'That's so weird.' Then, my brother turns to me and is like, 'Yeah sometimes if somebody does something, you know, naughty like flashes somebody or flicks the middle finger or something they don't put the photo up there.' I had this moment of, 'Do I tell the truth right now or do I just lie?' And then I was like, I think I have to say it.”</p><h2 id=she-hates-social-media><strong>She Hates Social Media</strong></h2><p>Just like so many Hollywood stars out there, Elisabeth Moss has a hard time understanding social media. While many people use it to help boost their careers, Elisabeth wants nothing to do with it. The only one that she will participate in is Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elisabeth had this to say, according to Pop Sugar, “Twitter scares me. I think it's so amazing, like the internet in general, because of the connection that it gives people. But the concept that one 140-word post can change someone's life... that scares me. You can literally ruin someone's life with one tweet. So I only do Instagram. I love photography... and interacting with the fans. I do love hearing from them. I try to answer questions if I can.”</p><h2 id=she-refuses-to-talk-to-leah-remini><strong>She Refuses To Talk To Leah Remini</strong></h2><p>As I’m sure we all know by now, Leah Remini wants to single-handedly take down the Church of Scientology, one secret at a time.</p><p><strong>Leah said that Elisabeth Moss isn’t allowed to speak to her, according to certain rules she must abide by because of Scientology. But it’s not like Elisabeth and Leah were really&nbsp;ever friends to begin with.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here’s what Leah Remini told Fox News back in 2017: “Elisabeth Moss believes that she can’t talk to me. There's a thing in Scientology called 'acceptable truth.' It means you only say what's acceptable to the public. But she believes that I'm an antisocial personality — because I've spoken out against Scientology. So she isn't allowed to talk to me. And me knowing that I wouldn't put her in the awkward position.”</p><h2 id=she-doesn-t-take-hollywood-seriously><strong>She Doesn’t Take Hollywood Seriously</strong></h2><p>Despite all of her success, Elisabeth doesn’t take Hollywood too seriously. She’s not as power or fame hungry as some of her counterparts are. Instead, she just treats her movie work like a day job. She wants to do a good job, get paid for putting her hours in, and then go home and relax.</p><p>“I wish I was super-serious, anguished,” Elisabeth told The Guardian in an interview back in 2016. “I see those actors and I am like, oh God, they are so cool and they seem so interesting. I don’t take acting that seriously. I love my work, but I do not think that I am saving the world, and I do not think that I am doing anything brave by accessing emotions that I might have for roles. I am a Valley girl.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-won-an-emmy-for-a-film-about-a-questionable-group-of-people><strong>She Won An Emmy For A Film About A Questionable&nbsp;Group Of People</strong></h2><p>Right after Elisabeth one a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress for her role in The Handmaid’s Tale, the media had a field day. A lot of people pointed out that Elisabeth – a Scientologist – won an Emmy for depicting a cult. Go figure.</p><p>Tony Ortega perhaps described it the best when he wrote on Twitter, “Elisabeth Moss wins Emmy for portraying totalitarian cult victim & doesn’t care what you think about it.”</p><p>Ortega further explained on his website, “Now that Moss has won the Emmy, we expect there’s going to be another round of think-pieces about her ability — what, is it hypocrisy? Indifference? A call for help? — which allowed her to play such a role without really addressing the questions by the media about her life in Scientology.”</p><h2 id=she-s-a-feminist><strong>She’s A Feminist</strong></h2><p>Elisabeth Moss has caused a lot of confusion about what her definition of “feminist” means.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Even though she stars in the wildly popular show, The Handmaid’s Tale, Elisabeth has gone on the record to say that a lot of people “need to be educated as to what feminism means.” And apparently, Elisabeth is here to school us all on the subject.</strong></p><p>She told The Guardian in an interview, “I spent seven seasons on Mad Men, playing what became considered a very feminist character. I was constantly being asked about feminism. And I could have, at that time, said what I said at Tribeca and it would have been fine. As a woman, now, you have to speak up,” she implores. “You have to own it [feminism] in a way that you never have before. It is different now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLBqbXNoKpmqJWkva2xjJ%2Bmq5%2BVqXqirs6uq2adnJ7Aoq7ErZ9mpZ%2BowHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alex-cappa-married-his-high-school-sweetheart-in-spring-of-2020.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Cappa Married His High School Sweetheart In Spring Of 2020">&larr;
