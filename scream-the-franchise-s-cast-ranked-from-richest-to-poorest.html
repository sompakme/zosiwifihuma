The widely successful <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scream franchise has earned more than $900,000 in the box office worldwide</a> and has become a staple during spooky season since the release of the first installment in 1996. Fans have come to know many of the Scream cast for the success they found in and after the horror franchise. Several of the Scream stars' net worths were greatly increased for appearing in multiple installments of the slasher series, but who is richest Scream cast member?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=courteney-cox><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Courteney Cox</span></h2><h3 id=net-worth-160-million>Net Worth: $160 Million</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Scream Character:</strong></p></td><td><p>Gale Weathers</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Scream Appearances:</strong></p></td><td><p>Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000), Scream 4 (2011), Scream (2022), Scream VI (2023)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong><a href=#>Courteney Cox</a></strong> takes the win for the richest Scream cast member. The actress played the ever-tenacious journalist Gale Weathers in all six Scream installments. Cox first rose to prominence when she portrayed Monica Geller in the iconic television series <strong><a href=#>Friends</a></strong>, which aired from 1994 to 2004.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress continues to bring in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">impressive $20 million per year</a> just off residuals from the Friends alone. In addition to her generous earnings from Friends, Courteney Cox also flexes her talent behind the camera in filmmaking, further contributing to her impressive net worth. The actress also owns her own production company named Coquette Productions, which was created by Cox and her then-husband David Arquette.</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Drew Barrymore</span></h2><h3 id=net-worth-125-million>Net Worth: $125 Million</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Scream Character:</strong></p></td><td><p>Casey Becker</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Scream Appearances:</strong></p></td><td><p>Scream (1996)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>While Drew Barrymore's <a href=#>very minor role of Casey Becker</a> in the first Scream film didn't last beyond the first few moments of the film, fans can't think of the franchise without her coming to mind.

While Pinkett Smith's <a href=#>complicated relationship with husband Will Smith</a> put her in the spotlight, the actress has a number of accolades under her belt that contribute Jada Pinkett Smith's net worth. Jada's big breakthrough came in 1996 when she starred with Eddie Murphy in the 1996 remake of The Nutty Professor, where she played his love interest. The film earned $25 million in its first weekend, eventually raking in more than $274 million worldwide, making it a complete commercial success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jada Pinkett Smith's appearance in two installments of the extremely successful and popular The Matrix series also added to her net worth.
