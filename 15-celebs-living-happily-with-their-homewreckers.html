There’s constant speculation over “who’s dating who,” the tabloids never let it rest. We become absolutely obsessed with the couple — whether we love them or hate them — and we watch their love blossom. Between the public and the media, we give them creative couple names, and we follow every move they make, and aspire to have their “relationship goals.” We love to see them get married, start families, and live out their own fairytale ending. We love to live vicariously through their love — the public absolutely eats that up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But, sometimes behind all of that glitz and glamour, things can get pretty ugly real quick. Over the years we have seen some cases of pretty scandalous celebrity cheaters and all kinds of infidelity. There’s been a number of cases from marriages breaking up because of co-workers on the sets of movies, to simply meeting the other person and falling in love at first sight, to even having some serious baby mama drama. Many have ended in heartbreak, with neither party having a happily ever after, while others persevered past the public scrutiny and the backlash of their affairs, and married their homewreckers, and found that fairytale ending that they were looking for.</p><p>Some celebrities didn’t care who their affairs hurt, as long as they got who they wanted in the end. These are 15 celebrities that are living happily with their homewreckers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tori-spelling-amp-dean-mcdermott>Tori Spelling & Dean McDermott</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tori Spelling</a> may have caused a lot of drama as Donna Martin on <i>90210</i>, but she’s sure caused even more drama in real life. Spelling married actor Charlie Shanian in 2004, and were very happy together. While filming the TV movie <i>Mind Over Murder</i> in 2005, she met actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dean McDermott</a> who would later turn her life upside down. At the time, McDermott was married to Mary Jo Eustace, whom he married in 1993.</p><p>Spelling claimed that the day they met was an instant connection, and immediately started seeing one another, despite the fact that they were both married. In April of 2006, Spelling and Shanian’s divorce was finalized, as well as McDermott and Eustace’s that same year. Spelling and McDermott wasted no time sealing the deal and officially tied the knot on May 7, 2006.</p><p>Although the two are still together today and have five children, they’ve had quite the rollercoaster relationship over the past decade. They face a number of financial troubles. McDermott also admitted to cheating on Spelling in 2013. Once a cheater always a cheater, right Dean?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie-amp-brad-pitt>Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt</h2><p>When you think of celebrity homewreckers, the first ones that usually come to mind are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a>. By far the most infamous, this couple definitely caused the scandal of the decade. The two met on the set of their movie <i>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</i> in 2005. At the time, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston, whom he married in 2000. They later announced their divorce and it was finalized in 2005.</p><p>Although Jolie insisted that there was no infidelity, they later admitted that they fell in love on the set of <i>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</i>, and once Pitt’s divorce was finalized, the two were seen more and more in public. In 2006, Jolie announced that she was pregnant with Pitt’s child, thus publicly confirming for the first time that they were a couple. In 2012 the couple announced their engagement, and married in 2014. Over the years the couple adopted three children and Jolie gave birth to three. Unfortunately for the beloved couple dubbed Brangelina, they separated in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although they aren’t “officially” together, there’s been a number of rumors swirling that they are still in each other’s lives, and that they are reconciling their differences. We only hope that Brangelina will rise again!</p><h2 id=gabrielle-union-amp-dwayne-wade>Gabrielle Union & Dwayne Wade</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwayne Wade</a> caused some serious drama when the world found out about his affair with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabrielle Union</a>. Not only did he have a marriage scandal, but some baby mama drama as well.</p><p>Wade married his longtime girlfriend Siohvaughn Fuches in 2002. The couple went on to have two sons — Zaire in 2002 and Zion in 2007. After the birth of their second son, they announced their separation. However, after a lot of back and forth and legal troubles, they didn't officially divorce until 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2009, Wade started dating Union while he was still legally married to Fuches. The couple decided to take a break in 2013 due to Wade’s career demands. That didn't stop Wade from hooking up with a woman named Aja Metoyer and got her pregnant. Metoyer had their son Xavier, in November, and Wade got back together with Union less than a month later, announcing their engagement soon after. The two were married a few months later.</p><p>Between ex wives and baby mamas, Wade was involved in it all, yet still managed to marry Union after everything. The two are still happily married today.</p><h2 id=leann-rimes-amp-eddie-cibrian>LeAnn Rimes & Eddie Cibrian</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LeAnn Rimes</a> caused quite a stir when her affair with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie Cibrian</a> came to light when both of them were married. Rimes was married to Dean Sheremet, a backup dancer that she met when she hosted the Academy of Country Music Awards in 2001. The two went on to marry in 2002. In the meantime, Eddie Cibrian married his wife, Brandi Glanville in May of 2001, and had two kids together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The soon-to-be lovers met on the set of their <i>Lifetime</i> movie, <i>Northern Lights</i> in 2009, and it was love at first sight. The two began their affair almost immediately after they met. The cat was out of the bag not much later, and both of their relationships came to an end. Rimes and Sheremet announced their separation in 2009, and their divorce was finalized in June of 2010, and Cibrian and Glanville announced their separation in July of 2009 with their divorce being finalized in September 2010.</p><p>Rimes and Cibrian wasted no time in taking their relationship to the next level. They announced their engagement in December of 2010, and tied the knot in April 2011. After all of the drama they caused, they’re still together and very much in love.</p><h2 id=tom-brady-amp-gisele-bundchen>Tom Brady & Gisele Bundchen</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most high-profile cases of celebrity infidelity, football star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Brady</a> and supermodel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gisele Bundchen</a> definitely made some headlines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brady dated actress Bridget Moynahan from 2004 to the very tail end of 2006. In February of 2007, Moynahan made the announcement that she was a few months pregnant — with Brady’s baby. Which means Brady broke up with her when he found out she was pregnant. It was for a good reason (in his eyes, apparently) because he immediately went public with Bundchen during this whole mess.</p><p>Moynahan gave birth in August of 2007, and told the media that she would be raising baby John as a single mother. Brady and Bundchen married in February of 2009, and together they have two kids, Benjamin and Vivian.</p><p>Despite the fact that Brady left Moynahan at a very important time in both of their lives, he seems to be happy with his choice as he and Bundchen are still very happy together.</p><h2 id=jerry-o-connell-amp-rebecca-romijn>Jerry O'Connell & Rebecca Romijn</h2><p>One case of celebrity infidelity that isn’t talked about that often is between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry O’Connell</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebecca Romijn</a>. In fact, the tea was spilled in ex-girlfriend, and famous TV personality on <i>E!</i>, Giuliana Rancic’s book.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>O’Connell and Rancic dated from 2003 to 2004. Rancic revealed that O’Connell had met Romijn at a party all three of them were attending. And the rest, was history. At the party O’Connell had become infatuated with Romijn and that was it for Rancic. This wasn’t the first time that he cheated on her. Rancic also revealed that before the whole mess with Romijn, O’Connell also cheated on her with Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, but she took him back.</p><p>He soon ended things with Rancic and began to date Romijn in 2004. The two got engaged in September of 2005 and eventually married in July of 2007. Together they have twins Dolly and Charlie, and are still happily married to one another today, despite Rancic spilling the tea on the beginning of their relationship.</p><h2 id=tiki-barber-amp-traci-lynn-johnson>Tiki Barber & Traci Lynn Johnson</h2><p>Classic case of fooling around with the intern (we're looking at you, Bill Clinton), football star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiki Barber</a> fell into that same trap, and cheated on his wife of nearly ten years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barber married Virginia Cha Barber in May of 1992. Together the couple has two sons, AJ and Chasin, and twin daughters Riley and Ella. The trouble began when Barber got involved with Traci Lynn Johnson, who was interning for NBC’s The <i>Today Show</i> at the time. Barber ultimately made his choice and decided to leave his wife to be with Johnson. The worst part? Virginia was seven months pregnant with Riley and Ella when he finally left her.</p><p>He went on to marry Johnson on July 20, 2012 — just eight days after his divorce was finalized. He and Johnson have two kids together, Brooklyn and Teagan. Despite that whole mess, Barber and Johnson are still happily married today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-roberts-amp-daniel-moder>Julia Roberts & Daniel Moder</h2><p>In 2000, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Roberts</a> was on the set of her movie <i>The Mexican</i> when she met the man that she would marry, and she definitely didn’t plan the way it would go down. Danny Moder was a cameraman working on the movie. Immediately, it was love at first sight for the two, and the rest was history. There was only one problem — they were both with other people. At the time, Roberts was seeing actor Benjamin Bratt while Moder was married to makeup artist Vera Steimberg. Wanting to be together officially and publicly, in 2001 Roberts ended things with Bratt while Moder divorced his wife.</p><p>Roberts and Moder eventually went on to marry on July 4th, 2002. Together they have three kids, Hazel, Phinnaeus, and Henry. There might have been a lot of bumps and broken hearts along the way, but they definitely did get their happily ever after and are still married today.</p><h2 id=alicia-keys-and-swizz-beatz>Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz</h2><p>If you wanted drama, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swizz Beatz</a> sure knows how to give it to you. Swizz Beatz (aka Kasseem Dean) is best known for being a rapper and being married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alicia Keys</a>. The rapper has quite the romantic history. He had a brief relationship with Nicole Levy and together they had a son, Prince, in 2000. He later went on to marry R&B recording artist Mashonda Tifrere in 2004. Together, they had a son, Kasseem Jr in 2006. A few years later the couple separated, but did not officially divorce until 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The drama doesn’t stop there. The rapper began dating Alicia Keys in 2008 while he was still legally married to Tifrere. But wait — that’s not all. His daughter Nicole was born in May 2008 that he fathered with Jahna Sebastian, a UK singer-songwriter. He did not find out about her until 2009.</p><p>Following all of that drama (if you could keep up) he finally married Alicia Keys in 2010. Together, they have two children, Egypt and Genesis. They’re still married today.</p><h2 id=kelsey-grammer-amp-kayte-walsh>Kelsey Grammer & Kayte Walsh</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelsey Grammer</a> began his affair when he met flight attendant Kayte Walsh. At the time he was married to his not first, not second, but his third wife, Playboy model Camille Donatacci. The two were married in 1997 and have two kids together. When Donatacci found out about her husband sneaking around with the flight attendant, she immediately filed for divorce in July of 2010, but it was not finalized until February of 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the meantime, Grammer announced that Walsh was pregnant in August of 2010, but unfortunately she miscarried a few weeks later. They announced their engagement in December 2010, and the two wasted no time making things official. They got married on February 25, 2011, just two weeks after his divorce was finalized.</p><p>Today the couple has three children together, Faith, Kelsey, and Auden. Walsh definitely has done something right, as the two still remain married today.</p><h2 id=jerry-seinfeld-amp-jessica-sklar>Jerry Seinfeld & Jessica Sklar</h2><p>When we think about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, we usually think about the funny guy with the very successful show — not a man involved in a cheating scandal.</p><p>It all began when Seinfeld met his future wife Jessica Sklar, one night at a Reebok Sports Club. She had just returned from her honeymoon after marrying husband Eric Nederlander in June of 1998. The two instantly hit it off and it was love at first sight. They began their affair not long after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everything moved rather quickly, and Sklar filed for divorce officially in October of 1998 — just four short months after tying the knot with Nederlander. Seinfeld and Sklar announced their engagement in November 1999 and were married not long after in December of the same year. The two went on to have three children, Sascha, Julian, and Shepherd. Both Sklar and Seinfeld are still happily married today. No word on how Nederlander is feeling.</p><h2 id=prince-charles-amp-camilla-parke-bowles>Prince Charles & Camilla Parke Bowles</h2><p>Across the pond, the royals aren't even exempt from a cheating scandal getting out, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Charles</a> is a prime example of that.</p><p>Prince Charles married Diana in July of 1981, and the two quickly became everyone's favorite royal couple. They had two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. Although the public saw them as some perfect couple, they had no idea what was going on behind closed doors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Diana and Charles are guilty of having affairs while married. However, Charles’ affair with Camilla Parke Bowles (who was also married at the time) actually developed into a real relationship once he and Diana announced their formal separation in 1992, and finalized their divorce in August of 1996. And we all know of the tragic passing of Diana in August of 1997.</p><p>Eventually Prince Charles proposed to Camilla in 2005 and the two were able to have a civil, not religious ceremony the same year. The two are still happily married today.</p><h2 id=bruce-springsteen-amp-patti-scialfa>Bruce Springsteen & Patti Scialfa</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Springsteen</a>, also known as “The Boss” has made a great impact on the music industry over the years. Despite his history-making music and hoards of adoring fans, he was also one of the many celebrities that fell into infidelity. In 1985 he married model and actress Julianne Phillips, and they were one talked about couple for a while. However, their marriage took a turn for the worse when Patti Scialfa joined the E Street Band in 1988, joining Springsteen for the Tunnel Of Love Express Tour. The two had an instant connection and fell in love on that tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Things became known to the public, and as a result, Springsteen divorced Phillips in 1989. Springsteen and Scialfa had their first child in 1990, and finally married in June of 1991. Following their marriage, the two had two more children and are still very much happily married today.</p><h2 id=jason-aldean-amp-brittany-kerr>Jason Aldean & Brittany Kerr</h2><p>Famous Country Star isn’t the only thing on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Aldean’s</a> resume — unfortunately he can add Cheater to that list. Aldean was married to Jessica Ussery in 2001. Together, they had two daughters, Keely and Kendyl. Unfortunately for this family of four, things went downhill in 2012. He was spotted in a bar getting cozy and kissing former <i>American Idol</i> contestant, Brittany Kerr. Of course, to save face, Aldean blamed it on the alcohol, and the fact that he was really intoxicated at the time. He even tried to use his wife at the time to convince the media that it was nothing but a drunken mistake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, it wasn’t. Aldean was seeing Kerr and eventually broke it off with his wife, and the two were officially divorced in 2013. Aldean and Kerr announced that they were engaged in September 2014, and the two tied the knot in March of 2015. Today, they’re still married and going strong, and they even have a little baby boy on the way, due in a few months.</p><h2 id=woody-allen-amp-soon-yi-previn>Woody Allen & Soon-Yi Previn</h2><p>Honestly the biggest WTF case of celebrity infidelity, we come to the infamous relationship between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woody Allen</a> and Soon-Yi Previn. Filmmaker Woody Allen began to date actress Mia Farrow in 1980. The two dated for twelve years, but never married. Farrow had a love for adopting children, and had done so in her previous marriage as well as with Allen. One of her children that she adopted during her previous marriage was Soon-Yi — you read that right, Farrow’s <i>adopted daughter</i>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January of 1992, Farrow discovered nude photos of 21-year-old Soon-Yi taken by Allen, thus also discovering that her daughter and her boyfriend were having an affair behind her back. Talk about messed up, right?</p><p>Like any other sane person would do, Farrow left Allen. Allen continued to be with Soon-Yi, and wound up getting married in December of 1997. The couple adopted two kids, Bechet and Manzie and are still (controversially) together today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2Ysq2xwaxkpaGmnruoeceap6mhnK56uLXToWStoJWev260zqacsKqVmLimvtJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./carly-simon-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carly Simon Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
