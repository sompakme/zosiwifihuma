This season he had joined Bay of Plenty for the Bunnings NPC.</p><p>He joined the Chiefs in 2018 and became a fan favourite either in the midfield or on the wing where he broke the record for number of tries in a Super Rugby game with five against the Waratahs in June 2021.</p><p>He began his Super Rugby career in Christchurch with the Crusaders, before switching to the Chiefs in 2018. Wainui had also become a fixture of the Maori All Blacks, while he had switched from Taranaki to Bay of Plenty for this year’s Bunnings NPC tournament.</p><p>Wainui was born in the small settlement of Whatatutu near Gisborne and raised in Auckland before attending Takapuna Grammar School where he was a stand-out as captain of the first XV before making his debut for Taranaki in 2014, while still a teenager. A year later he won the Junior World Championship with the New Zealand Under 20 team, earned his first Super Rugby contract with the Crusaders, and represented the Māori All Blacks for the first time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sean-wainui-age></span> Sean Wainui Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sean Wainui was born on 23 October 1995, in Whatatutu, New Zealand.

He hit a tree while driving in Omanawa, near Tauranga, on New Zealand’s north island. Bay of Plenty Police released a statement saying one person had died in a single-vehicle accident, with NZ Rugby later confirming that person was Wainui.</p><p>In a statement, New Zealand Rugby said: “One of Rugby New Zealand’s tallest totara trees has fallen in the world of rugby. To you Sean, our Rangatira, we farewell you to the outspread arms of the multitudes who await you beyond this earthly realm. You leave us here bereft and drown in sorrow as we weep for you. Rest well in peaceful repose.”</p><p>New Zealand Rugby chief executive Mark Robinson extended all of rugby’s condolences to Sean Wainui’s wife Paige, their children Kawariki and Arahia, and their wider whānau on what is a dark day for rugby. Robinson said: “Our thoughts are with Sean and his whānau, particularly Paige, Kawariki and Arahia, and we offer them our full support at what is the most difficult of times. We know Sean’s passing will be felt deeply by everyone involved in rugby, particularly his Bay of Plenty and Chiefs teammates, and we share their sorrow and their shock.</p><p>“We ask that media give the Wainui whānau space to grieve as we all reflect on a young life that has ended far too early.”</p><p>New Zealand Māori Rugby Board Chair Farah Palmer said: “Today rugby is mourning one of our Rangatira, but our first thoughts are with Sean’s whānau. They have lost a father, a husband, a brother and a son and we share their grief and their tears.</p><p>“As a player we all saw what this young tāne was capable of and the passion and talent that he brought to the teams he represented, but we also saw a role model for young Māori, a caring father who was passionate about his culture, his language, and his identity. He will be sorely missed.”</p><p>Māori All Blacks, Chiefs and former Bay of Plenty Head Coach Clayton McMillan said: “Sean was an incredibly talented individual and held a great amount of mana among his fellow teammates and the wider rugby community. He epitomised everything you could possibly ask for in a player. He will be remembered for being a passionate, hard-working, proud Māori who was an exceptional player but more importantly father and husband.</p><p>“He was an influential member in the teams he has been a part of, and his presence will be missed. Our sincere condolences to Paige, Kawariki and Arahia and his wider whānau at this difficult time. We are offering them our full support along with our players and staff.”</p><p>The Gallagher Chiefs tweeted: “One of Rugby NZ’s tallest totara trees has fallen. To you Sean, our Rangatira, we farewell you to the outspread arms of the multitudes who await you beyond this earthly realm. You leave us here bereft and drown in sorrow as we weep for you. Rest well in peaceful repose.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sean-wainui-height></span> Sean Wainui Height<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was 191 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sean-wainui-instagram></span> Sean Wainui Instagram<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sean Wainui’s Instagram handle is @seanwainui.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKuVlrtuw8Cipa6hXay2rLWMmp6eZaees6Z5wpqsrJ1dpLNusMSaq6Fllpa6qrjYZp%2BeoZedwW6%2FwKWYq7Fdo7K1edaoqa2gXaWus8DNnqlmqJGnsq%2FA0magp6uklrSzrcxo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-umbrella-academy-season-3-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 'Umbrella Academy' Season 3 Cast Ranked By Net Worth ">&larr;
