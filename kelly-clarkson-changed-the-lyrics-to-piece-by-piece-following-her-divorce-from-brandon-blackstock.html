Since she won this singing competition, she has released ten studio albums, having sold more than 25 million copies and 45 million singles across the world. Plus, she’s proven she can do much more than perform and write her own songs. Clarkson is now a successful author, television host, and vocal coach after joining The Voice for its fourteenth season a couple of years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite her recent <a href=# rel=nofollow>divorce from Brandon Blackstock</a>, Kelly Clarkson still has an estimated net worth of $45 million, and her career is better than ever. Despite this, the ‘Stronger’ singer is not happy about the way things ended with Blackstock and she’s letting fans know it. In a recent performance, Clarkson changed the lyrics to a song that was originally written for her ex-husband to show how she feels about him now.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly Clarkson Lived In Her Car Before American Idol Fame (And Was Shunned At First)</a></span></p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-thinks-her-relationship-with-brandon-blackstock-was-destined-to-fail-due-their-first-date>Kelly Clarkson Thinks Her Relationship With Brandon Blackstock Was Destined To Fail Due Their First Date</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar50300226-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kelly Clarkson first met her ex-husband, Brandon Blackston, in 2006 at a rehearsal for the Academy of Country Music Awards. "This guy walks by, making everybody laugh. I said, 'I'm gonna end up with him. I know it,' " the singer told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">People</a> of their first encounter. However, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth at the time.</p><p>Six years later, Clarkson and Blackstock met again at the Super Bowl. "I was so nervous because it wasn't that I didn't want to suck for the millions of people watching, I didn't want to suck because I was trying to impress a guy," Clarkson spoke about how she felt about performing the national anthem at the big game to SiriusXM in 2017. "I wanted him to be like, 'Damn.' It had nothing to do with the Super Bowl!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly Clarkson Fans Accuse Her Of Being A Bad Mom For This Controversial Reason</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The American Idol alum admitted that, at that time, Blackstock thought she hated him. Despite this, they ended up going out on their first date that same year, which was marked by a tragic event. "This is the funniest/worst thing ever: One of my superhero idols is Whitney Houston, and the day she died was our first date," Clarkson said. "I was like, 'This is a bad omen."</p><p>Despite the bad omen on their first date, Clarkson and Blackstock kept on dating before announcing their engagement in December 2012. The couple officially tied the note in October of the next year and welcomed their daughter, River Rose, in 2014. Two years later, the pair welcomed their second baby, son Remington Alexander, and seemed to be going stronger than ever.</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-has-called-her-divorce-from-brandon-blackstock-traumatic>Kelly Clarkson Has Called Her Divorce From Brandon Blackstock Traumatic</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar49964268.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Kelly Clarkson filed for divorce from Brandon Blackstock after seven years together, citing irreconcilable differences. The singer has now admitted that, at first, her <a href=# rel=nofollow>ego prevented her from filing for divorce</a>. Ultimately, she did it because it was the best for her.</p><p>Nearly two years later, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Clarkson and Blackstock’s divorce</a> was officially finalized. Per court documents, Clarkson was ordered to pay Blackstock a massive one-time payment of just over $1.3 million, as well as $195,601 monthly in spousal and child support. Of course, all of this, along with pricey legal fees, <a href=# rel=nofollow>affected Clarkson’s overall net worth</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Is Kelly Clarkson And Brandon Blackstock's Divorce Settlement 'Fair'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to losing a ton of money, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kelly Clarkson has admitted that her divorce from Blackstock has been so traumatic</a> that it’s been affecting her mental health. The singer has been going to therapy since she was married to Blackstock but her recent sessions have helped her process everything better. “I’d never really done regular therapy or anything like that,” Clarkson told Entertainment Tonight. “They give you so many tools for how to navigate certain situations.”</p><h2 id=kelly-clarkson-changed-the-lyrics-to-lsquo-piece-by-piece-rsquo-to-shade-ex-brandon-blackstock>Kelly Clarkson Changed the Lyrics To ‘Piece By Piece’ To Shade Ex Brandon Blackstock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kelly-clarkson.jpg><p>‘Piece by Piece’ is one of Kelly Clarkson’s most iconic songs. Originally debuted in her 2015 album, the song was written to praise her now ex-husband Brandon Blackstock for not following in the neglectful footsteps of her father. But, in a recent performance at her Las Vegas residency, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Clarkson changed the lyrics to this song</a> to show fans how she feels about Blackstock now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“This song I initially wrote was just super hopeful, right? And well, sometimes hopeful turns into hopeless, so here we go, ‘Piece by Piece,'” Clarkson told the audience. She then amended the lyrics to the song by switching the mentions of "he" to "I" along the song. So, instead of saying, “He never walks away / He never asks for money / He takes care of me / He loves me," it went, “I just walk away / when they ask for money / I take care of me / ’cause I love me.”</p><p>These lyrics clearly shade at Blackstock and the fact that <a href=# rel=nofollow>Clarkson had to pay him millions for spousal support</a>. This new version of ‘Piece by Piece’ is now a post-heartbreak, empowering anthem, and fans couldn’t love it more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqScrnqkuMCroqynnmKwqa3NoJydZaSdsm642KugnKtdqbxuvMiemp5lkq56sbXEnJxmnp%2BhubDDyKeeZqCVp3qltdWoqZydXZu%2FsLmMm6mappSku26uy5qapKukpLCsew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kentucky-hunting-forum-list-of-kentucky-hunting-discussions-and-forums.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kentucky Hunting Forum  List of Kentucky Hunting Discussions and Forums">&larr;
