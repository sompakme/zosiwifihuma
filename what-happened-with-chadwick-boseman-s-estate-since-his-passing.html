Boseman was not an instant success, but eventually, he began to show his talents when given the right opportunities. Eventually, the talented actor became a superstar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Early roles were pivotal in his career taking off, and things hit a fever pitch when he played Black Panther for the very first time in Captain America: Civil War. From there, everything was coming up aces for Boseman.</p><p>The actor starred in several notable MCU movies, including his solo outing, Black Panther, which generated over $1 billion at the box office. Throw in a couple Avengers movies and announced future titles, and Boseman's future was brighter than ever.</p><p>Fans soaked up every second of his time on the big screen, but in August 2020, they were floored at the news of his unexpected passing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans React To Lupita Nyong’o's Tribute To Chadwick Boseman's Death Anniversary</a></span></p><h2 id=chadwick-boseman-39-s-passing-was-kept-private>Chadwick Boseman's Passing Was Kept Private</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a><strong>, "</strong>US actor Chadwick Boseman, best known for playing Black Panther in the hit Marvel superhero franchise, has died of cancer aged 43. He died at home in Los Angeles with his wife and family by his side, a statement posted on social media said.</p><p>Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer four years ago but had not made the information public."</p><p>That last part is key, as no one knew what was going on with the star's health. Some people on social media had noticed that his enthusiasm in public appearances seemed to wane, but they had little idea that the star was battling cancer.</p><p>Fans and former co-stars voiced their shock surrounding his passing, and they showed their support for the family.</p><p>At the 2021 NAACP Image Awards, Boseman's wife accepted and award on his behalf, delivering a memorable speech.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"As always, he would give all honor and glory to the most high God. He would thank his mom and dad, and he would give honor to the ancestors as we now honor him. Thank you NAACP Image Awards for always giving him his flowers," she said upon accepting the award. "He was an uncommon artist and an even more uncommon person. But the manner in which we lost him is not uncommon at all. Not in our community," she said.</p><p>In a surprising turn of events, Boseman passed without a will.

Due to the lack of will and testament upon his death, the legal fees are higher than usual and his $3.8 million estate is now valued closer to $2.3 million or $2.5 million, with outlets citing conflicting amounts. 50 percent of that figure will go to his widow, while each parent will get 25 percent," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a> reports.</p><p>At long last, his family knows how things will be divvied up.</p><p>The site also gave some insight into Boseman's marriage with Ledward.</p><p>"Boseman began dating Simone Ledward prior to his cancer diagnosis in 2016, and his family confirmed they privately got married before his death. "He died in his home, with his wife and family by his side," the statement from his family read when his death was announced. She asked a judge in October 2020 to make her an administrator of his estate," the site stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Most Heartbreaking Things Chadwick Boseman‘s Wife Said After His Passing</a></span></p><p>The world will never get the chance to see another Chadwick Boseman, and while his passing has been unimaginably difficult for his family, his estate's distribution is at least one thing off of their plate.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Chadwick Boseman’s Brother Reveals That He Would Want His Black Panther Role Recast</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXay2tbSMnJ%2BanKeesKx5waiqnqWRo8BusdKtmK2dXai2r6%2FEZp%2Biq12lrrS%2FyKeeaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./antonio-margarito-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Antonio Margarito Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
