I find her very beautiful," he stated. However, he had a problem with her political inclinations. "I think she's liberal. She probably doesn’t like Trump," he lamented.

"<strong>She is liberal, or is that just an act?</strong>" he asked the editor during their interview. "She's legitimately liberal? It's not an act? It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal."</p><p>Swifties reacted almost instantly, angry with the former president for dragging the singer into a political debate and reducing her to her looks. "You keep Taylor’s name out of your filthy mouth!" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a user wrote on X</a>. Several other people called him a "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">creepy old man</a>" and claimed Taylor should get a "restraining order."</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-opinion-on-donald-trump>Taylor Swift's Opinion On Donald Trump</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-10.jpg><p>While Taylor Swift isn't known for getting involved in politics, she did take a clear stance against Trump in both the 2020 election.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">she tweeted at Donald Trump</a>, calling for people to vote against him. "After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? 'When the looting starts the shooting starts'??? <strong>We will vote you out in November</strong>," she ranted.</p><p>She also, in 2018, wrote about the midterm elections and implied she regretted not speaking up in 2016.</p><p>"<strong>In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions</strong>, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">she wrote on Instagram</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent."</p><p>Knowing this, it's probably safe to say that, much like her fans, Taylor Swift didn't appreciate Donald Trump's shout-out in his new book.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqsKGWqbamv4yfrKuhn6rAbrDOp5ilnF2pv7a5z2aqrp%2BXmsC1tdWeZJynnaKyr8DSZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./david-tennant-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Tennant Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
