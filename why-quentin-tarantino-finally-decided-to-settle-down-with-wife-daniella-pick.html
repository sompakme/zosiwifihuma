In reality, however, there are a lot of directors that don’t really have that much control as movie stars and producers wield more authority on their sets. When it comes to Quentin Tarantino, however, there is no doubt that he is the one who runs the show on his sets. For proof of that fact, all you have to do is look at reports about <a href=#>what it is like to work with Tarantino</a> or keep in mind that <a href=#>Quentin’s best movies</a> all have a similar style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Things Actors Have Said About Working With Quentin Tarantino</a></span></p><p>As a result of the fact that Quentin Tarantino has such a distinctive style and almost all of his movies have been very successful, he has become one of the most famous directors in history. Unsurprisingly, that has resulted in Tarantino's personal life winding up in the tabloids a lot partially since he has been linked to some notable stars. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, after years of being linked to several women, what made Tarantino settle down with his wife Daniella Pick?</p><h2 id=who-has-quentin-tarantino-dated-in-the-past>Who Has Quentin Tarantino Dated In The Past?</h2><p>During Quentin Tarantino’s time in the public eye, one thing has always been very clear, the man never is short on opinions. After all, when Tarantino gets interviewed, all the person talking to him has to do is bring up a topic that Quentin cares about and the director will go off on a diatribe infused with pop culture references. Despite how verbose he typically is, Tarantino often has remained quiet when it comes to the topic of his romantic life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Men Uma Thurman Has Been Linked To</a></span></p><p>As a result of the fact that Quentin Tarantino rarely talks about his love life, many of the relationships the director is believed to have been in are only rumored. For example, Tarantino is rumored to have dated Uma Thurman in 2014, Vivica A. Fox in 2002, and Kathy Griffin in 1995.</p><p>On top of his rumored relationships, it is known that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quentin Tarantino dated several women before getting involved with his wife</a>. Most notably, Tarantino and Mira Sorvino dated from 1996 until 1998 and she has spoken about the love they shared. Tarantino also is confirmed to have dated Shar Jackson, Serah Henesey, Julie Dreyfus, and Sofia Coppola according to whosdatedwho.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-made-quentin-tarantino-settle-down-with-his-wife-daniella-pick>What Made Quentin Tarantino Settle Down With His Wife Daniella Pick?</h2><p>During the first several years of Quentin Taratino’s relationship with Daniella Pick, it didn’t seem like he was ever going to change his ways by walking down the aisle. After all, Tarantino and Pick dated each other without getting engaged from 2009 until 2017. On top of that, the same year that he began dating Pick, Tarantino said something to GQ that made it seem like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he prioritized making movies over dating or being a father</a>.</p><p>"When I'm doing a movie, I'm not doing anything else. It's all about the movie. I don't have a wife. I don't have a kid. Nothing can get in my way. The whole (expletive) world can go to hell and burst into flames. I don't care. This is my life."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Don't Want To Get Married (And Why)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite that comment making it seem very clear that marriage and fatherhood weren’t in the cards any time soon, Tarantino went on to say something that cracked the door to the possibility. "I'm not saying that I'll never get married or have a kid before I'm 60. But I've made a choice, so far, to go on this road alone. Because this is my time. This is my time to make movies."</p><p>As it turns out, Quentin Tarantino’s 2009 comments about marriage were a harbinger of things to come. After all, it wasn’t until 2017 that he would get engaged. On top of that, Tarantino went on to get married in 2018 and in recent years, <a href=#>he has been talking about the prospect of retiring</a> from making movies a lot more. Given that Tarantino is now married and a father of one, it makes sense that he is eyeing the exit based on his past comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even knowing that Quentin Tarantino had to get into a different mindset before he got married, the question remains, what changed his priorities? Did Tarantino decide to become a family man and Pick happened to be the person in his life at that time or did she play a role in the director’s decision to settle down? According to what he told the AP News in 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pick was the inspiration behind Tarantino settling down</a>. “I just got married six months ago. . . . I have never done that before - and now I know why: I was waiting for the perfect girl.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is Quentin Tarantino's Wife, And What Does She Do?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdpsKmutOipWaskaeur8DIp6ZmpZGnv6qxw2auop6VYrGiusieo5ploJ6wrHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./20-celebs-who-caused-major-movie-delays-that-nearly-ended-them.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Celebs Who Caused Major Movie Delays (That Nearly Ended Them)">&larr;
