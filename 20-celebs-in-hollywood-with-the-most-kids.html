Babies might be cute, but they're also the loudest, neediest, and most expensive thing we can have in our homes. The average cost of raising a child in the US is $233,610. Then again, that figure can be a fraction of a movie star's salary. Or the monthly earnings from a new album drop. In 2018, Kanye West sent out a series of typically confident tweets. Insisting that he was "battling fake news," Kanye announced that Yeezy would "hit a billion this year." This guy may not reach his goals, but the cost of raising a child isn't exactly a problem Kanye's household.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, a fair few celebrities added a new addition to their brood. Dwayne Johnson welcomed his third child. So did Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Three kids&nbsp;aren't&nbsp;the world's biggest number, but most families consider three children to be just the handful they need. Beyonce and Jay Z have three. Victoria and David Beckham have four. We aren't here to examine the families with three, four, or five kids. We're looking at Hollywood's baby factories. Some of these faces have more baby mommas and daddies than we can count. The kids? We can just about keep count. Here are 20 Hollywood faces with the most babies (and counting).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-19-just-isn-t-enough><strong>WHEN 19 JUST ISN'T ENOUGH</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar welcomed their 20th child. The couple was granted "temporary guardianship" of an 8-year-old boy – as if having 19 of their own wasn't enough. In 2008, this devout Baptist family had to rename their 17 Kids and Counting reality show to reflect the family's new size. Michelle and Bob have a staggering 19 children total, and the 19 Kids and Counting show made them a household name. This family has earned millions from showing us that they can bring no less than 19 children into the world. No one else does it quite like the Duggars, and they take the top spot.</p><h2 id=dmx-couldn-t-name-his-15-children><strong>DMX COULDN'T NAME HIS 15 CHILDREN</strong></h2><p>DMX is the kind of hip-hop royalty that gets a #OldSkool. The 47-year-old rapper is two years older than Eminem, but he might as well be a grandfather when it comes to the number of relatives he has. Earl Simmons, a.k.a. DMX has 15 children, the last of which was born in 2016. DMX was every inch the proud father when The Rickey Smiley Morning Show called him to send congratulations, but he struggled on the most important question. According to Digital Music News, DMX rolled off most of the names but struggled to finish naming all 15.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>On a 2016 radio show, DMX failed to name all 15 of his children.</strong></p><h2 id=dog-the-bounty-hunter-has-twelve><strong>DOG THE BOUNTY HUNTER HAS TWELVE</strong></h2><p>Amazing how reality stars can return to the front page news, right? In May 2018, Duane "Dog The Bounty Hunter" Chapman made headlines after he reassured the world that his wife was safe following the Kilauea volcano eruption in Hawaii. This came after his wife, Beth had braved a serious health battle. This couple first exploded onto our screens back in 2004. Dog the Bounty Hunter was a reality show that brought us the bounty hunter lifestyle, plus a pretty big family. Duane has been married five times and has a total 12 children. Now aged 65, we'll assume that he won't have any more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eddie-murphy-is-expecting-number-ten><strong>EDDIE MURPHY IS EXPECTING NUMBER TEN</strong></h2><p>Eddie Murphy knows a thing or two about entertainment – and parenting. The iconic comedian and actor was himself raised in the foster system after his parents split when he was just 3 years old. In 2018, Hello reported that Eddie is expecting his 10th child with his girlfriend, Paige Butcher. The 57-year-old is already a dad to nine kids. These include five kids from his 1993 marriage and a daughter with Melanie Brown, a.k.a. The Spice Girl's Sporty Spice. A rep told People: "Eddie Murphy and longtime girlfriend Paige Butcher are pleased to announce that they are expecting their second child in December."</p><h2 id=master-p-is-a-father-of-nine><strong>MASTER P IS A FATHER OF NINE</strong></h2><p>Master P just got name-dropped on Kanye West's "Clique" track. This rapper has 14 studio albums, 40 singles, a net worth of $250 million– oh, and 9 kids. His first child, Percy "Lil Romeo" was born in 1989. Between 1989 and 2003, Percy Robert Miller, a.k.a. Master P had 8 other children. His marriage to Sonya Miller ended in a bitter divorce, but this rapper has plenty of love for his family. Ready for their names? From first-born to last, Master P is a dad to: Percy "Lil Romeo," Vercy, Tytyana, Veno, Inty, Hercy, Cymphonique, Itali, and Mercy. Hands full?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jon-and-kate-come-with-eight><strong>JON AND KATE COME WITH EIGHT</strong></h2><p>It's been nearly 10 years since the last episode of Jon and Kate Plus 8. Kate Gosselin is now a 43-year-old with four books, a solo reality career, plus an upcoming Kate Plus Date show. We have a weird fascination with reality – especially when it's ordinary Americans with a little something different. With Kate and Jon, that "something different" came in the form of six babies, a set of twins, and some pretty strict discipline. Radar Online reported Kate's former nanny saying that she had to clean up chicken muck and abide by strict rules. Kate received criticism&nbsp;in 2014, when her former nanny outlined Kate's "meltdowns."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie-found-love-with-six><strong>ANGELINA JOLIE FOUND LOVE WITH SIX</strong></h2><p>Nobody ever predicted that Angelina Jolie would follow a path of healing, love, and charity. Angelina flew the flag for all things "rebel child" during the 90's and 2000s. In 2005, Angelina began her relationship with Brad Pitt. Although their eventual marriage ended in divorce, these two seemed very happy during their 12 years together. Angelina adopted three kids from impoverished countries, alongside the three kids that she and Brad welcomed biologically. Pax, Maddox, and Zahara joined Shiloh-Nouvel, plus twins, Vivienne and Knox. Ange continues to be papped with the kids.</p><h2 id=kris-jenner-s-six-made-her-millions><strong>KRIS JENNER'S SIX MADE HER MILLIONS</strong></h2><p>This family might not be the largest in Hollywood, but it's set to be the richest. Kylie Jenner is fronting Forbes' "Self-Made Billionaire" cover. Kim K is Hollywood's queen bee. Kendall Jenner raked in $22 million in 2017. The backbone of this cash-churning family is Kris Jenner, though. Kris gets a cut of her kids' incomes, a healthy Keeping Up With The Kardashians&nbsp;salary, and executive producer rights, plus she earns plenty from endorsements. Youthful as Kris may look, this 63 year-old mom and grandmother has six kids. Kim, Khloe, Kourtney, Kendall, Kylie, and Rob have earned Kris millions. There's a huge amount of love backing it up, though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mel-gibson-has-nine-children><strong>MEL GIBSON HAS NINE CHILDREN</strong></h2><p>Mel Gibson has had a bit of a fall from grace. The Braveheart and Lethal Weapon actor had his fan base divided after a series of questionable statements and personal circumstances in the 2000s. In 2017, Mel was back in the news after he welcomed his 9th child. Unlike many other celebrities with lots of children, Mel actually had one of the longest-lasting marriages in Hollywood – he was married to Robyn Gibson for 26 years before his 2006 divorce. Mel has a total 9 children. Their names are: Milo, Hannah, Christian, Lars, Lucia, Louis, Edward, Thomas, and William. Mel's girlfriend is nearly half his age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fetty-wap-has-seven-at-27><strong>FETTY WAP HAS SEVEN AT 27</strong></h2><p>Fetty Wap's debut single was titled "Trap Queen." With a minimum of six baby mommas, the moniker has stuck. The New Jersey-born rapper has described his style as "ignorant R&B," although he has achieved what is arguably the greatest praise there is – Fetty Wap got name-dropped on Nicki Minaj's 2018 Queen album. With 7 kids at the age of 27, Fetty Wap may well be Hollywood's youngest multi-daddy. Aydin Zoovier, Eliza, Amani, Lauren, and Alaiya were recently joined by a baby boy named Zy. Alaiya and Zy were fathered with his girlfriend, Lezhae Zeona. Their newest addition is a total cutie.</p><h2 id=madonna-has-a-six-strong-brood><strong>MADONNA HAS A SIX-STRONG BROOD</strong></h2><p>Madonna remains one of the greatest music icons of all time. The "Queen of Pop" has reinvented herself more times than we can count. Even Madonna didn't expect to find peace and harmony from motherhood, though. The mom of six told The Telegraph that motherhood had "grounded her," saying: "I was so selfish, motherhood has mellowed me." Madonna has a total 6 children, four of whom are adopted. Madonna's biological daughter, Lourdes Leon is now a major celebrity in her own right (plus she is the total spitting image of her mother). Madonna's adopted children are from the African nation of Malawi, where the star helps build communities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus-is-one-of-six><strong>MILEY CYRUS IS ONE OF SIX</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Miley Cyrus told The Tonight Show that her sister is "almost cooler" than she is. Miley is a celeb kid who has become way more famous than her musician father – Billy Ray Cyrus nicknamed his daughter after that brilliant smile. Celebrities tend to let their siblings take a back seat, but Miley only has love for hers. Miley is one of six children. Billy Ray Cyrus is also a father to the lower-profile musicians: Trace and Noah Cyrus, plus Brandi, Braison, and Christopher Cody. Billy has been married twice. Of course, Miley's engagement to Liam Hemsworth makes way more headlines.</p><h2 id=mike-tyson-had-eight-kids><strong>MIKE TYSON HAD EIGHT KIDS</strong></h2><p>The fatherhood story comes with a touch of sadness for the legendary Mike Tyson. In 2011, The Daily Mail reported that Mike was celebrating the arrival of his 8th child following the passing of his 4-year-old son. The baby news came 18 months after Mike's daughter, Exodus, was the victim of a tragic accident. The boxing legend and actor had previously admitted to being "totally broke" on The View. Mike sees life positively, though. "But I have an awesome life, I have an awesome wife who cares about me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=octomom-had-eight-in-one-go><strong>OCTOMOM HAD EIGHT IN ONE GO</strong></h2><p>Most couples are pleasantly surprised when the doctor announces that&nbsp;they will be having&nbsp;twins. The chances of having triplets and quads are surprisingly high, at 1 in every 67 pregnancies, according to Twins UK. 2009 brought us multiple births on a whole other level, though. Octomom was the nickname given to Nadia Suleman. This California-born media figure used IVF treatment to allow her to carry eight babies at once, and it sure made headlines. By 2017, Nadia's total number of kids had risen to 14. In an interview with The Daily Mail, Nadya said that she was "finally at peace" with her 14 children.</p><h2 id=p-diddy-is-a-daddy-of-six><strong>P DIDDY IS A DADDY OF SIX</strong></h2><p>With only Jay Z topping him, Sean Combs, a.k.a. P Diddy is the second-richest rapper of all time. With his $825 million fortune, Diddy's wealth is nearing $1 billion – Diddy is a man who knows money. He is also a man with almost as many stage names as he has children. We've known Puff Daddy. We've known Diddy. Now going by P Diddy, the rapper who is a daddy to six might not have the most kids on this list, but he is the richest celebrity. Not surprisingly, Diddy gifted his son, Justin a $360,000 Maybach car and chauffeur for Justin's 16th birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-federline-also-has-six><strong>KEVIN FEDERLINE ALSO HAS SIX</strong></h2><p>Talk about a blast from the past. In 2018, Britney Spears was reported as "not being happy" with Kevin Federline's demands for more money. ET Online has covered this former couple's continued custody disputes, although Britney is coming out in a much better light than she used to. Britney and Kevin share two sons – Britney's responsible parenting has seen her offer "to take the boys more often," but Kevin isn't budging. With not much in the way of success in his life, Kevin did, however, manage to become a father six times. Jayden James and Sean Preston are the best-known since they are shared with Britney.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=t-i-continues-the-pattern><strong>T.I. CONTINUES THE PATTERN</strong></h2><p>Hip-hop has always made headlines. With 8.9 million Instagram followers, T.I. is a rapper and actor who pulls off his youthful 37 years enough to hang with Young Jeezy and Gucci Mane. Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. is most commonly known as T.I or Tip. Maybe it was a coincidence, but T.I.'s most-successful album was his sixth – that is precisely how many children he has. T.I. had three kids with his ex-wife, Tameka "Tiny" Cottle, alongside three others. T.I. has faced legal issues, although he and Tiny are working on reconciling. These kids may be from different baby mommas, but their dad is worth $50 million.</p><h2 id=willie-nelson-has-seven-kids><strong>WILLIE NELSON HAS SEVEN KIDS</strong></h2><p>Few artists have the kind of legendary reputation that Willie Nelson has. The 85-year-old country music star is the original deal, and his Outlaw Country style paved the way for endless artists. The Texan musician comes as an all-American package of rocker vibes, country spirit, and he is rarely seen without his guitar. Willie Nelson has been married four times. He finds himself on this list on account of his seven children. Lana, Susie, and Billy came from his first marriage. With his third wife, Willie had Paula and Amy. Willie's fourth marriage raised the father-of-five to one of seven with Lucas and Jacob.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-sheen-is-a-dad-of-five><strong>CHARLIE SHEEN IS A DAD OF FIVE</strong></h2><p>Putting food on the table is less of an issue when your job lands you up to $2 million per episode. The headlines for this sitcom star were more "Charlie Sheen's fall from grace" following his personal troubles, but this actor was once the highest-paid man on TV. In 2018, News.com reported that Charlie was having "a difficult time" paying child support. The actor has five kids – two were with the actress, Denise Richards. Charlie has been married (and divorced) three times. His Anger Management salary was $2 million per episode.</p><p><strong>Charlie Sheen earned $1.8 million a week during Two and a Half Men.</strong></p><h2 id=shaquille-o-neal-fills-santa-stockings-for-five><strong>SHAQUILLE O'NEAL FILLS SANTA STOCKINGS FOR FIVE</strong></h2><p>You're also looking at what is quite possibly the tallest Santa in the world. Shaquille O'Neal is over 7 feet tall. Height like that will get you into the NBA, but this basketball superstar built his career on pure talent. Shaquille has five children – Shareef, Shaqir, Me'arah, Amirah, and Taahirah. Four kids are from Shaquille's marriage to Shaunie Nelson. They married in 2002, but filed for divorce in 2009. Shaquille regularly posts pics of himself and the kids on social media. This is a dad who cares.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hit share on Facebook before these moms and dads add any more – whether you were surprised at DMX's 15 or you wondered how a 27-year-old Fetty Wap can be a dad of seven, get this out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmV6pLHLnpmsZZmjeqm7y6WwsKefmXq4tdOhZK2glWK6sL%2FTZqKinKNk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-peek-inside-kawhi-leonard-s-17-million-la-mansion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Peek Inside Kawhi Leonard's $17 Million LA Mansion">&larr;
