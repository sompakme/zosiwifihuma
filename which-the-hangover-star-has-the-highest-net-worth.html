It is difficult to make an R-rated comedy a huge success, but as we have seen in the past with movies like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Pie</a>, it is possible for these films to thrive financially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hangover</a> was a colossal success upon its release, and it helped turn its lead actors into major Hollywood stars, most notably <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradley Cooper</a>. This, in turn, helped them all boost their net worths considerably.</p><p>Let’s see which&nbsp;Hangover star has the highest net worth.</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper-is-number-one-with-100-million>Bradley Cooper Is Number One With $100 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/744E3A5E-7A1A-47A3-857D-ED952C70A578.jpeg><p>Bradley Cooper has done a lot of exceptional work throughout his career, and his time in The Hangover was a huge piece of the puzzle that turned him into a genuine A-list star. Thanks to the success of the franchise and a string of other hit films, Bradley Cooper currently has a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he had done some work in film and television, most notably on the show Alias&nbsp;prior to landing one of the lead roles in The Hangover, it was his time in the first film that really put him on the map. Of course, the Hangover movies did make him a considerable amount of money, but the work that Cooper has done outside of this franchise has been lucrative, as well.</p><p>Through the years, Bradley Cooper has appeared in smash hit films like Silver Linings Playbook, Wedding Crashers, A Star is Born, American Hustle, American Sniper, and he is the voice of Rocket Raccoon in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise. Yeah, the guy stays winning, and he has the bank account to prove it.</p><p>On top of all of the exceptional work that he has already done, Bradley Cooper has at least two more Marvel movies on the horizon, meaning that he’s going to continue banking millions while voicing Rocket. He will also take part in plenty of other projects outside of Marvel, and if his track record is any indication, then he is poised for a ton of success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As great as this is for Cooper, his fellow co-stars have made bank, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This 'The Hangover' Scene Almost Cost A Stunt Double His Life</a></span></p><h2 id=zach-galifianakis-is-next-with-40-million>Zach Galifianakis Is Next With $40 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/82FA905D-ACAC-4F14-B922-8E4C28906776.jpeg><p>Zach Galifianakis is one of the funniest comedic performers working today, and his distinct style and delivery has been instrumental in him standing out from the pack. Thanks to his work in the Hangover franchise and other comedy hits,&nbsp;Galifianakis currently finds himself with a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$40 million</a>.</p><p>Outside of the Hangover films, Galifianakis has appeared in movies like The Muppets, Birdman, and Due Date. He was even in A Wrinkle in Time, and he voiced the Joker in The Lego Batman Movie, which was a huge success at the box office.
